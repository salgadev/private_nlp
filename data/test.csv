3, Laparoscopic Appendectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute appendicitis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  Laparoscopic appendectomy.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix.,OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area.  The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.  Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.gastroenterology, appendix, endobag, laparoscopic appendectomy, acute appendicitis, appendectomy, umbilically, abdominal, pneumoperitoneum, laparoscopic, appendicitis, suprapubic, mesoappendix, "

The patient was taken to the operating room for an I&D of the lacerations with wound closure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled out to the operating theater room #5.  Before the neck instrumentation was performed, the patient's lacerations to her scalp were I&D'ed and closed.  It was noted that the head was significantly contaminated with blood as well as mangled.  It was decided at that time in order to repair the lacerations appropriately, the patient would undergo cutting of her hair.  This was shaved appropriately with shavers.  Once this was done, the scalp lacerations were copiously irrigated with a scrubbing brush, hexedine solution together with peroxide.  Once this was appropriately debrided with regards to the midline incision with the scalp going through the midline of her skull as well as the incision on the left aspect of her scalp, the wounds were significantly irrigated with normal saline.  No significant debris was appreciated.  Once this was done, staples were used to oppose the dermal edges together.  The patient was subsequently dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape.  The neck procedure was subsequently performed.surgery, drainage, incision, primary wound closure, lacerations, wound closure, scalp lacerations, scalp, i&d,"

Repair of one-half full-thickness left lower lid defect by tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap from left upper lid to left lower lid.,2.  Repair of left upper and lateral canthal defect by primary approximation to lateral canthal tendon remnant.,ASSISTANT: , None.,ANESTHESIA: , Attended local by Strickland and Associates.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  Dressing was removed from the left eye, which revealed the defect as noted above.  After systemic administration of alfentanil, local anesthetic was infiltrated into the left upper lid, left lateral canthus, and left lower eyelid.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic fashion.  Protective scleral shell was placed in the left eye.  A 4-0 silk traction sutures placed through the upper eyelid margin.  The medial aspect of the remaining lower eyelid was freshened with straight iris scissors and fibrin was removed from the inferior aspect of the wound.  The eyelid was everted and a tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap was developed by incision of the tarsus approximately 3-1/2-4 mm from the lid margin the full width of the eyelid.  Relaxing incisions were made both medially and laterally and Mueller's muscle was subsequently dissected free from the superior tarsal border.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then anchored to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and one 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The protective scleral shell was removed from the eye.  The medial aspect of the eyelid was advanced temporally.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then cut to size and the tarsus was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  The conjunctiva and lower lid retractors were attached to the advanced tarsal edge with a running 7-0 Vicryl suture.  The upper eyelid wound was present.  It was advanced to the advanced tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally.  The conjunctival pedicle was slightly trimmed to make a lateral canthal tendon and the upper eyelid was advanced to the tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally with an interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture, it was then secured to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin muscle flap was then elevated, was draped superiorly and nasally and was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  Burrows triangle was removed as was necessary to create smooth wound closure, which was closed with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture.  Temporally the orbicularis was resuspended from the advanced skin muscle flap with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture to the periosteum overlying the lateral orbital rim.  The skin muscle flap was secured to the underlying tarsoconjunctival pedicle with vertical mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl followed by wound closure temporally with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture with removal of a burrow's triangle as was necessary to create smooth wound closure.  Erythromycin ointment was then applied to the eye and to the wound followed by multiple eye pads with moderate pressure.

1, Pacemaker (Single Chamber) ,"SINGLE CHAMBER PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block with AV dissociation and syncope.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block, status post single chamber pacemaker implantation, Boston Scientific Altrua 60, serial number 123456.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.,2.  Left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.,3.  Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.,4.  Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.,5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.  No significant bleed.surgery, mobitz, av dissociation, syncope, mobitz type ii block, boston scientific altrua, subclavian, venogram, ventricular, single chamber pacemaker implantation, single chamber pacemaker, pacemaker implantation, pacemaker, vein, chest, atrium, ventricle, atrial, implantation, chamber, "

These were representing on the order of 50% or more of the circumference of her lower leg.  They were in a distribution to be consistent with stasis ulcers.  They were granulating nicely and she was scheduled for surgery.,FINDINGS:,  Large ulcers of lower extremities with size as described above.  These are irregular in shape and posterior and laterally on the lower legs.  There was no evidence of infection.  The ultimate skin grafting was quite satisfactory.,PROCEDURE: , Having obtained adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped from the pubis to the toes.  The legs were examined and the wounds were Pulsavaced bilaterally with 3 liters of saline with Bacitracin.  The wounds were then inspected and there was adequate hemostasis and there was only minimal fibrinous debris that needed to be removed.  Once this was accomplished, the skin was harvested from the right thigh at approximately 0.013 inch.  This was meshed 1:1.5 and then stapled into position on the wounds.  The wounds were then dressed with a fine mesh gauze that was stapled into position as well as Kerlix soaked in Sulfamylon solution.,She was then dressed in additional Kerlix, followed by Webril, and splints were fashioned in a spiral fashion that avoided foot drop and stabilized them, and at the same time did not put pressure across the heels.  The donor site was dressed with Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.surgery, skin graft, lower extremities, split thickness skin grafting, skin grafting, kerlix, grafting, extremities, ulcers, leg, "

1, Blepharoplasty ,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.

4, Arthroplasty - Hammertoe ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Arthroplasty of the right second digit.,The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe.  The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications.podiatry, hammertoe deformity, arthroplasty, digit, proximal interphalangeal joint, periosteal tissue, interrupted sutures, interphalangeal joint, proximal phalanx, proximal, painful, tourniquet, hammertoe, phalanx, head, incisional, tendon"

Carpal tunnel syndrome.,2. de Quervain's stenosing tenosynovitis.,TITLE OF PROCEDURE,1.  Carpal tunnel release.,2. de Quervain's release.,ANESTHESIA: , MAC,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease.  The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.  The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches.,The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip.  Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches.  I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side.  Both ends of the sheath were released to lengthen them, and then these were repaired with 4-0 Vicryl.  It was checked to make sure that there was significant room remaining for the tendons.  This was done to prevent postoperative subluxation.,I then irrigated and closed the wounds in layers.  Marcaine with epinephrine was placed into all wounds, and dressings and splint were placed.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.surgery, de quervain's release, carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, carpal, incision, aponeurosis, tunnel, cut,"

We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above. "
2, Neurologic Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,consult - history and phy., lethargy, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, shunted hydrocephalus, seizure breakthrough, shunt malfunction, neurologic consultation, neurologic, seizure, trileptal"

Exploratory laparotomy.,2.  Extensive lysis of adhesions.,3.  Right salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 200 mL,SPECIMENS:  ,Right tube and ovary.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , Extensive adhesive disease with the omentum and bowel walling of the entire pelvis, which required more than 45 minutes of operating time in order to establish visualization and to clear the bowel and other important structures from the ovarian cyst, tube, and ovary in order to remove them.  The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass.  Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions.  Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid.  Cyst wall, tube, and ovary were stripped away from the bowel.  Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube.  There was excellent postoperative hemostasis.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient's prior incision.  Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached.  Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures.  At this point, the extensive adhesive disease was noted, again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery.  The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient's right side developing a window.  This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum.  A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course.  Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst.  Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst.  Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment, the cyst was ruptured.  Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated.  The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient's small and large bowel.  Once the bowel was freed, the remnants of round ligament was identified, elevated, and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space.,The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels, which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels, but superior to the course of the ureter.  This pedicle was doubly clamped, transected, and tied with a free tie of #2-0 Vicryl.  A suture ligature of #0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle.  The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary, which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum.  Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels.  However, a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur, which was clamped with a right-angle clamp, and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted.  Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed.,The opposite tube and ovary were identified, were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube.  Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal.  It was then left in situ.  Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery.  The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution.  The peritoneal edges were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle, and the ovarian vessel pedicle.  The areas of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease, it was carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis was noted.,All instruments and packs removed from the patient's abdomen.  The abdomen was closed with a running mattress closure of #0 PDS, beginning at the superior aspect of the incision, and extending inferiorly.  Excellent closure of the incision was noted.  The subcutaneous tissues were then copiously irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved with the use of cautery.  Subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted sutures of #0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with staples.,Incision was sterilely clean and dressed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

She was admitted because of recurrent nausea and vomiting, with displacement of the GEJ feeding tube.  A CT scan done yesterday revealed evidence of feeding tube remnant still seen within the stomach.  The endoscopy is done to confirm this and remove it, as well as determine if there are any other causes to account for her symptoms.  Physical examination done prior to the procedure was unremarkable, apart from upper abdominal tenderness.,MEDICATIONS: , Fentanyl 25 mcg, Versed 2 mg, 2% lidocaine spray to the pharynx.,INSTRUMENT: , GIF 160.,PROCEDURE REPORT:,  Informed consent was obtained from Mrs. ABC's sister, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications.  Consent was not obtained from Mrs. Morales due to her recent narcotic administration.  Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position.  The endoscope was then passed through the mouth, into the esophagus, the stomach, where retroflexion was performed, and it was advanced into the second portion of the duodenum.,FINDINGS:,1.

3, Cardioversion - Direct Current - 1 ,"PROCEDURE:  ,Direct-current cardioversion.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 53-year-old gentleman with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for 3 years.  He had a wide area of circumferential ablation done on November 9th for atrial fibrillation.  He did develop recurrent atrial fibrillation the day before yesterday and this is persistent.  Therefore, he came in for cardioversion today.  He is still within the first 4 to 6 weeks post ablation where we would attempt early cardioversion.,The patient was in the SDI unit, attached to noninvasive monitoring devices.  After Brevital was brought by the anesthesia service a single 150 joule synchronized biphasic shock using AP paddles did restore him to sinus rhythm in the 80s.  He tolerated it well.  He will be observed for couple hours and discharged home later today.  He will continue on his current medications.  He will follow back up in two to three weeks in the Atrial Fibrillation Clinic and then again in a couple months with myself.,CONCLUSIONS / FINAL DIAGNOSES: , Successful DC cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.cardiovascular / pulmonary, direct-current cardioversion, circumferential ablation, paroxysmal atrial, dc cardioversion, direct current, atrial fibrillation, ablation, cardioversion,"
2, Ant Bait Exposure - ER Visit ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Possible exposure to ant bait.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 14-month-old child who apparently was near the sink, got into the childproof cabinet and pulled out ant bait that had Borax in it.  It had 11 mL of this fluid in it.  She spilled it on her, had it on her hands.  Parents were not sure whether she ingested any of it.  So, they brought her in for evaluation.  They did not note any symptoms of any type.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Negative.  Generally very healthy.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , The child has not been having any coughing, gagging, vomiting, or other symptoms.  Acting perfectly normal.  Family mostly noted that she had spilled it on the ground around her, had it on her hands, and on her clothes.  They did not witness that she ingested any, but did not see anything her mouth.,MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Stable vital signs and normal pulse oximetry.  GENERAL:  The child is very active, cheerful youngster, in no distress whatsoever.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is clear, moist, and well hydrated.  I do not see any evidence of any sort of liquid on the face.  Her clothing did have the substance on the clothes, but I did not see any evidence of anything on her torso.  Apparently, she had some on her hands that has been wiped off.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  I discussed the case with Poison Control and apparently this is actually relatively small quantity and it is likely to be a nontoxic ingestion if she even ingested, which should does not appear likely to be the case.,IMPRESSION: , Exposure to ant bait.,PLAN: , At this point, it is fairly unlikely that this child ingested any significant amount, if at all, which seems unlikely.  She is not exhibiting any symptoms and I explained to the parents that if she develops any vomiting, she should be brought back for reevaluation.  So, the patient is discharged in stable condition.emergency room reports, borax, vomiting, exposure to ant bait, ant bait, exposure, symptoms,"

The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus.  It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision.  It was carried down to the fascia.  An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique.  Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion.  The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas.  It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips.  The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery.  There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie.  The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones.  The fascia had to be opened.  The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully.  When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis.  The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope.  The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl.  All the incisions were injected with 0.25% Marcaine, closed with 4-0 Monocryl, Steri-Strips, and sterile dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.gastroenterology, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cholecystitis, gallbladder fossa, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, acute cholecystitis, gallbladder"

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in the supine position.  The foreskin was retracted and cleansed.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans.  The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French.  We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen.,We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff.  We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap.  Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection.  He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck.  We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight.  We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them.  Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings.  The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate.  The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter.  We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl.  We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well.  5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans.  Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff.  On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect.,At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place.  IV Toradol was given at the procedure.

The patient was then transferred to the operating room table in supine position with Johnson knee holder well-padded.  Tourniquet was placed around the left upper thigh.  The limb was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Standard anteromedial and anterolateral arthroscopy portals were obtained and a systematic examination of the knee was then performed.  Patellofemoral joint showed frequent chondromalacia.  Examination of the medial compartment showed a displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus involving the entire posterior, parietal, and portion of his anterior portion of the medial meniscus.  The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were unaffected.  Intercondylar notch examination revealed an intact ACL and PCL stable to drawer testing and probing and the lateral compartment showed an intact lateral meniscus.  The femoral condyle and tibial plateau were all stable to probing.  Attention was then directed back to the medial compartment where the detached portion of the meniscus was excised using arthroscopy scissors.  A shaver was then used to smooth all the edges until the margins were stable to probing.,The knee was then flushed with normal saline and suctioned dry.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the knee and into the arthroscopy portals.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were applied followed by a TED hose.

The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove.  Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed.  The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down.  The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size.  The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified.  All the layers of the spermatocele were removed.  Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied.  Entire spermatocele sac was removed.  After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained.  The testicle was not in normal orientation.  The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle.  The testicle was placed in a normal orientation.  Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord.  Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations.  Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion.  There was excellent hemostasis.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.surgery, orchidopexy, spermatocele, spermatocelectomy, scrotal"
4, Wilson's Disease - Letter ,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter is an introduction to my patient, A, who you will be seeing in the near future.  He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease.  It has been treated with penicillamine.  He was diagnosed with this at age 14.  He was on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort.  He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate.  He was admitted there and observed.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions.  He was started on Lopressor, which he has tolerated well.  An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement.  Normal ejection fraction.  No other significant valvular abnormality.  He reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease.  Therefore hepatologist was consulted.  There was a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.,In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease, however, he has never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt.  His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.,I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control.  He is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008.  He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty.  I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.,I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman.  His current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day.,If you have any questions regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discuss his case.  Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.  Thank you as always for your care of our patient.neurology, atrial enlargement, wilson's disease, penicillamine,"

Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the upper and lower left quadrants and extraction of teeth was begun on the upper left quadrant teeth numbers 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were removed with elevators and forceps extraction.  Moving to the lower quadrant on the left side, tooth numbers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 were removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  The flaps were then closed with 3-0 gut sutures and upon completion of the two quadrants on the left side, the endotracheal tube was then relocated from the right side to the left side for access to the quadrants on the right.  Teeth numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were then removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  It was noted that tooth #6 was missing, could not be seen whether tooth #6 was palately impacted, but the tooth was not encountered.  On the lower right quadrant, teeth numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 were removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  Tooth #32 was partially bony impacted, but exposed, so it was removed by removing bone on buccal aspect with high-speed drill with a round bur.  Tooth was then luxated from the socket.  The flaps were then closed on both quadrants with 3-0 gut sutures.  The area was irrigated thoroughly with normal saline solution and a total of 8.5 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100, 000 epinephrine and 3.6 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200, 000.

1, Trabeculectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:, Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, XXX eye 0.3 c per mg times three minutes.,INDICATIONS: ,This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: ,The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.

He does have decreased sensation to light touch in the L4-L5 distribution of his feet bilaterally.,X-rays taken including AP and lateral of the right knee demonstrate a healed medial tibial plateau fracture status post percutaneous screw fixation.  Examination of three views of the right foot demonstrates the second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  These appear to be extraarticular.  They are all in a bayonet arrangement, but there appears to be bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Four months status post percutaneous screw fixation of the right medial tibial plateau and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.,PLANS: , I would like the patient to continue working with physical therapy.  He may be weightbearing as tolerated on his right side.  I would like him to try to continue to work to gain full extension of the right knee and increase his knee flexion.

She was counseled to undergo staging laparotomy.,FINDINGS:,  Examination under anesthesia revealed a small uterus with no nodularity.  During the laparotomy, the uterus was small, mobile, and did not show any evidence of extrauterine spread of disease.  Other abdominal viscera, including the diaphragm, liver, spleen, omentum, small and large bowel, and peritoneal surfaces, were palpably normal.  There was no evidence of residual neoplasm after removal of the uterus.  The uterus itself showed no serosal abnormalities and the tubes and ovaries were unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthesia was induced, after which she was examined, prepped and draped.,A vertical midline incision was made and fascia was divided.  The peritoneum was entered without difficulty and washings were obtained.  The abdomen was explored with findings as noted.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneal spaces were opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided, and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.,Retroperitoneal spaces were then opened, allowing exposure of pelvic vessels and ureters.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments were isolated, divided, and doubly ligated.  The uterine artery pedicles were skeletonized, clamped, divided, and suture ligated.  Additional pedicles were developed on each side of the cervix, after which tissue was divided and suture ligated.  When the base of the cervix was reached, the vagina was cross-clamped and divided, allowing removal of the uterus with attached tubes and ovaries.  Angle stitches of o-Vicryl were placed, incorporating the uterosacral ligaments and the vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.  The pelvis was irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were repositioned to allow exposure for lymphadenectomy.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to incise lymphatic tissues.  Borders of the pelvic node dissection included the common iliac bifurcation superiorly, the psoas muscle laterally, the cross-over of the deep circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.

4, Barium Swallow Study & Speech Evaluation - 1 ,"SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals.  Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: ,Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.,PLAN: , Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:,1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.,3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.,The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.speech - language, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, cognitive linguistic deficit, tia, stroke, swallowing function, swallow study, barium swallow study, globus sensation, esophageal, penetration"

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.surgery, obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy, pharyngitis, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, uvula, obstructive, adenotonsillar, hypertrophy, hypertrophic, fossa, tonsils, oropharynx, electrocautery, pads"

Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, Adriamycin, and Abraxane.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 47-year-old female who was noted to have abnormal vaginal bleeding in the fall of 2009.  In March 2010, she had an abnormal endometrial ultrasound with thickening of the endometrium and an enlarged uterus.  CT scan of the abdomen on 03/22/2010 showed an enlarged uterus, thickening of the endometrium, and a mass structure in the right and left adnexa that was suspicious for ovarian metastasis.  On 04/01/2010, she had a robotic modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorotomy and appendectomy with pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy.  The pathology was positive for grade III endometrial adenocarcinoma, 9.5 cm in size with 2 cm of invasion.  Four of 30 lymph nodes were positive for disease.  The left ovary was positive for metastatic disease.  Postsurgical PET/CT scan showed left lower pelvic side wall seroma and hypermetabolic abdominal and right pelvic retroperitoneal lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic disease.  The patient has completed five of planned six cycles of chemotherapy and comes in to clinic today for followup.  Of note, we had sent off genetic testing which was denied back in June.

4, Cataract Extraction - 1 ,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens placement by phacoemulsification.,ANESTHESIA:,  Peribulbar.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room after the eye was dilated with topical Mydriacyl and Neo-Synephrine drops.  A Honan balloon was placed over the eye for a period of 20 minutes at 10 mmHg.  A peribulbar block was given to the eye using 8 cc of a mixture of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine mixed with Wydase plus one-half of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The Honan balloon was then re-placed over the eye for an additional 10 minutes at 20 mmHg.  The eye was prepped with a Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A wire speculum was placed in the eye and then a clear corneal paracentesis site was made inferiorly with a 15-degree blade, followed by instillation of 0.1 cc of preservative-free lidocaine 1% into the anterior chamber, followed by viscoelastic.  A 2.8-mm keratome was used to create a self-sealing temporal corneal incision and then a bent capsulotomy needle was used to create an anterior capsular flap.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous tear capsulorrhexis, and hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus was performed with BSS on a cannula.  Phacoemulsification in a quartering-and-cracking technique was used to remove the nucleus and then the residual cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  Gentle vacuuming of the central posterior capsule was performed.  The capsular bag was re-expanded with viscoelastic, and then the wound was opened to a 3.4-mm size with an additional keratome to allow insertion of the intraocular lens.,The intraocular lens was folded, inserted into the capsular bag and then un-folded.  The trailing haptic was tucked underneath the anterior capsular rim.  The lens was shown to center very well.  Therefore, the viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit and one 10-0 nylon suture was placed across the incision after Miochol was injected into the anterior chamber to cause pupillary constriction.  The wound was shown to be watertight.  Therefore, TobraDex ointment was applied to the eye, an eye pad loosely applied and a Fox shield taped firmly in place.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.ophthalmology, phacoemulsification, hydrodissection, peribulbar block, irrigation and aspiration, honan balloon, anterior chamber, anterior capsular, aspiration unit, capsular bag, cataract extraction, intraocular lens, cataract, extraction, peribulbar, lidocaine, viscoelastic, chamber, epinephrine, anterior, capsular, lens, intraocular, eye, "

Masticatory dysfunction.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Maxillary atrophy.,2.  Severe mandibular atrophy.,3.  Acquired facial deformity.,4.  Masticatory dysfunction.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Autologous iliac crest bone graft to maxilla and mandible under general anesthetic.,Dr. X and company accompanied the patient to OR #6 at 7:30 a.m.  Nasal trachea intubation was performed per routine.  The bilateral iliac crest harvest was first performed by Dr. X and company under separate OR report.  Once the bone was harvested, surgical templets were used to recontour initially the maxillary graft and the mandibular graft.  Then, CAT scan models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  Subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  Surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  Xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  A primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  Release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,A full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  The contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  The hard palate was directly observed.  The facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  Similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  The area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  The block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  A surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  A series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  Particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  A piece of AlloDerm mixed with Croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  The tissues were expanded then with a tissue Metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 Gore-Tex.  Attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  A primary incision was made between the mental foramina and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  The anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  A posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  A tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  A similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  The tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  A block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  The block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  Particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  A piece of AlloDerm was placed over those particulate segments.  The tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 Gore-Tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  The tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the flap.,The estimated blood loss in the harvest of the hip was 100 cc.  The estimated blood loss in the intraoral procedure was 220 cc.  Total blood loss for the procedure 320 cc.  The fluid administered 300 cc.  The urine out 180.  All sponges were counted encountered for as were sutures.  The patient was taken to Recovery at approximately 12 o'clock noon.dentistry, autologous iliac crest bone graft, to, mandible, mandibular atrophy, maxillary atrophy, facial deformity, masticatory dysfunction, iliac crest bone graft, mental foramina, iliac crest, bone, autologous, maxillary, mandibular, maxilla"

4, Hallux Infected Bone Resection ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/Local.,HISTORY:,  This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux.  The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.

The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. "

On physical exam, the patient was found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such as watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent was obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.  Cystoscopy revealed there was a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There was no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder was normal.  Rectal exam was normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There was good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley was removed and the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.obstetrics / gynecology, vault prolapse, rectocele repair, rectocele, vaginal mass, metzenbaum scissors, ureteral openings, vaginal mucosa, colpocleisis, vaginal, infection,"

3, Appendectomy - Laparoscopic  ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pelvic inflammatory disease.,2.  Periappendicitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Laparoscopic appendectomy.,2.  Peritoneal toilet and photos.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 cc.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 31-year-old African-American female who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain presented with acute appendicitis.  She also had mild leukocytosis with bright blood cell count of 12,000.  The necessity for diagnostic laparoscopy was explained and possible appendectomy.  The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department.,The preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall.  A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation.  At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally.  A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view.  With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized.  The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken.  There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst.  Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant.  The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears.  Attention was turned to the suprapubic area.  The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified.  A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line.  Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline.  Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant.  There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease.  All free fluid is aspirated and patient's all port sites are removed under direct visualization and the appendix is submitted to pathology for final pathology.  Once the ports are removed the pneumoperitoneum is allowed to escape for patient's postoperative comfort and two larger port sites at the suprapubic and infraumbilical sites are closed with #0 Vicryl suture on a UR-6 needle.

3, Laryngectomy & Thyroid Lobectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Total laryngectomy, right level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection, tracheoesophageal puncture, cricopharyngeal myotomy, right thyroid lobectomy.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , A 58-year-old gentleman who has had a history of a T3 squamous cell carcinoma of his glottic larynx having elected to undergo a laser excision procedure in late 06/07.  Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later.endocrinology, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage"

Necrotic testes.,SURGERY:,  Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy.,DRAINS:,  Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum.,The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000.  The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.  The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.urology, testicular abscess, necrotic testes, orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, orchidopexy, hemiscrotum, testicular torsion, penrose drain, scrotal swelling, scrotal wall, testicle, torsion"

3, SynchroMed Pump Placement ,"PROCEDURES:,1.  Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.pain management, intrathecal, catheter, paraspinous, cerebrospinal, synchromed infusion pump, synchromed pump catheter, synchromed pump, paraspinous muscle, cerebrospinal fluid, tunneling device, infusion pump, subcutaneous tissue, infusion, synchromed, pump, incision,"

There was a large amount of tissue obtained on the procedure.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum and due to the patient already being dilated approximately 2 cm, no cervical dilation was needed.  A size 12 straight suction curette was used and connected to the suction and was placed in the cervix and a suction curettage was performed.  Two passes were made with the suction curettage.  Next, a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a small amount of tissue and this was followed by third suction curettage and then a final sharp curettage was performed, which revealed a good uterine cry on all sides of the uterus.  After the procedure, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The cervix was seemed to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was removed.  The patient was given 0.25 mg of Methergine IM approximately half-way through the procedure.  After the procedure, a second bimanual exam was performed and the patient's uterus had significantly decreased in size.  It is now approximately eight to ten-week size.  The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition after she was cleaned.  She will be discharged on today.

MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.surgery, low back syndrome, low back pain, nerve root decompression, steroid solution, c-arm, epimed, tun l catheter, nerve root, negative aspiration, omnipaque dye, filling defect, nerve, root, catheter, adhesions, injection, needle,"

He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.

4, Bunionectomy - Austin - Akin ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Austin/akin bunionectomy, right foot.,HISTORY: , This 77-year-old African-American female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had a bunion deformity for as long as she can remember that has progressively become worse and more painful.  The patient has attempted conservative treatment without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  An IV was instituted by Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety strap across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed around the right ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo block type fashion.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated to the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating field and the stockinet was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was directed to the bunion deformity on the right foot.  An approximately 6 cm dorsal medial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated with hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue were then undermined off of the capsule medially.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The periosteum and capsule were then reflected off of the first metatarsal.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  The articular cartilage was healthy for patient's age and race.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed..  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was carried out until the adductor tendon insertions were identified.  The adductor tendons were transected as well as a lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor hallucis longus to make sure that tendon that was transected was the extensor hallucis brevis at the _______ digitorum.  Extensor hallucis brevis tendon was transected and care was taken to preserve the extensor halucis longus tendon.  Attention was then directed to medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Sagittal was then used to create a long dorsal arm outside the Austin type osteotomy and the first metatarsal.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally until correction of the intermetatarsal angle was noted.  The head was intact.  A 0.45 K-wire was inserted through subcutaneously from proximal medial to distal lateral.  A second K-wire was then inserted from distal lateral to proximal plantar medial.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site.  The K-wires were bent, cut, and pin caps were placed.  Attention was then directed to the proximal phalanx of the hallux.  The capsular periostem was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal was then used to create an akin osteotomy closing wedge.  The apex was lateral and the base of the wedge was medial.  The wedge was removed in the total and the osteotomy site was then feathered until closure was achieved without compression.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted, one from distal medial to proximal lateral and the second from distal lateral to proximal medial across the osteotomy site.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site and the osteotomy was closed.  The toe was noted to be in a markedly more rectus position.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining prominent medial eminence.  The area was then smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  There was noted to be a small osteophytic formation laterally over first metatarsal head that was removed with a rongeur and smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  The area was then inspected for any remaining short bony edges, none were noted.,Copious amounts of sterile saline was then used to flush the surgical site.  The capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular #5-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips were applied and 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the surgical site.,Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, copious Betadine, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.  A _______ cast was then applied postoperatively.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported from the operating room to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Tylenol #3 and instructed to take one q4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.podiatry, austin/akin bunionectomy, hallucis brevis, bunion deformity, extensor hallucis, osteotomy site, foot, austin, bunionectomy "

4, Arachnoid Cyst ,"CC:, Seizures.,HX: ,The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as ""dizzy spells"" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.,BIRTH HX:, 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment.,PMH: ,Single febrile convulsion lasting ""3 hours"" at age 2 years.,MEDS: ,none.,EXAM:, Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.,Impression: Psychomotor seizures.,Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.,EEG showed ""minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding."",COURSE:, The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed ""Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.neurology, arachnoid cyst, hct scan, seizures, serial hct scans, dizzy spells, drowsiness, hyperventilation, loss of consciousness, moderate amplitude asymmetry, temporal area, tonic-clonic movement, phenobarbital, dilantin, cyst, temporal, arachnoid"

2, Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy ,"INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices.  The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time.  The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.  Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis occurs.  The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition, organs at risk are outlined.  Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk.  Associated dose constraints are placed.  Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician.  Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk.  This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications.  The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume.  During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance.  In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.,In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.radiology, multiple beam arrangements, intensity modulated radiation therapyNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.

The patient was intubated by anesthesia orotracheally using a #7 ET tube.  The patient was induced in effective sleep using a propofol and gas inhalation anesthetics.  Following intubation, the patient's mouth was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a toothbrush following placement of a throat pack.  At that point, approximately 5 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:20,000 epinephrine was injected for a right inferior alveolar block, as well as local infiltration in the right long buccal nerve area as well as the right cheek area.  Local infiltration also was done near the tooth #32.  At this point, a periosteal elevator was used to loosen up the gingival tissue of the teeth #1, #29, and #32; and all 3 teeth were extracted using simple extraction, using elevators and forceps.  In addition, the previous Penrose drain was removed by removing the suture, and the incision that was used for I&D on the previous day was extended laterally.  A hemostat was used to puncture through to the right buccal space.  Approximately, 2.5 to 3 mL of purulence was drained, and that was used for Gram stain and culture, as mentioned above.  Following copious irrigation of the area, following the extraction and following the incision and drainage, 2 quarter-inch Penrose drains were placed in the anterior as well as the posterior section of the incision into the buccal space.

She has subsequently been on tamoxifen.  Ultrasound did show a thickened endometrial stripe as well as an adnexal cyst.  The above procedures were therefore performed.,FINDINGS:  ,On bimanual exam, the uterus was found to be slightly enlarged and anteverted.  The external genitalia was normal.  Hysteroscopic findings revealed both ostia well visualized and a large polyp on the anterolateral wall of the endometrium.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a normal-appearing uterus and normal left ovary.  There was no evidence of endometriosis on the ovaries bilaterally, the ovarian fossa, the cul-de-sac, or the vesicouterine peritoneum.  There was a cyst on the right ovary which appeared simple in nature.  The cyst was aspirated and the fluid was blood tinged.  Therefore, the decision to perform oophorectomy was made.  The liver margins appeared normal and there were no pelvic or abdominal adhesions noted.  The polyp removed from the hysteroscopic portion of the exam was found to be 4 cm in size.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the posterior vaginal vault in the 12 o'clock position and the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then sounded in the anteverted position to 10 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank and Hegar dilators up to a Hank dilator of 20 and Hagar dilator of 10.  The hysteroscope was then inserted and the above findings were noted.  A sharp curette was then introduced and the 4 cm polyp was removed.  The hysteroscope was then reinserted and the polyp was found to be completely removed at this point.  The polyp was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed as a means to manipulate the uterus.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Using a sterile saline drop test, appropriate placement was confirmed.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume inflow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was placed without difficulty.  The above findings were then visualized.  A 5 mm port was placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was done under direct visualization and the grasper was inserted through this port for better visualization.  A 12 mm port was then made in the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and the Endo-GIA was inserted through this port and the fallopian tube and ovary were incorporated across the infundibulopelvic ligament.  Prior to this, the cyst was aspirated using 60 cc syringe on a needle.  Approximately, 20 cc of blood-tinged fluid was obtained.  After the ovary and fallopian tube were completely transected, this was placed in an EndoCatch bag and removed through the lateral port site.  The incision was found to be hemostatic.  The area was suction irrigated.  After adequate inspection, the port sites were removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was desufflated.  The infraumbilical port site and laparoscope were also removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then injected locally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms.,PROCEDURE: , After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.,A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.

Rule out sepsis, was negative as blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were negative.,3. Organic brain syndrome.,4. Seizure disorder.,5. Adrenal insufficiency.,6. Hypothyroidism.,7. Anemia of chronic disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted through the emergency room.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done.  He was placed on IV Rocephin.  His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given.  The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses.  The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X.  Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.  He tolerated these poorly with residuals.  Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added.  The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range.  Other vital signs have been stable.  His urine output has been diminished.  An external jugular line was placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's legal guardian, Janet Sanchez in Albuquerque has requested he be transported there.  As per several physicians in Albuquerque and Dr. Y, an internist, we will accept him once we have a nursing home available to him.  He is being transported back to the nursing home today and discharge planners are working on getting him a nursing home in Albuquerque.

Glenoid labrum tear.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement.,2.  Subacromial decompression.,3.  Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS:,  Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital.  This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticularly, the joint was observed.  There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear.  The biceps complex was otherwise intact.  There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint.  Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface.  Subacromially, the same was true.  This was an elliptical to V-type tear.  The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  He was safely placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion.  Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum.  The biceps was probed and noted to be intact.  Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment.,After this, instrumentation was removed.  The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters.  An anterolateral portal was created.  Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire.  With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.  Superolateral portal was then created.  A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone.  _______ suture was placed.  The implant was put into place.  The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory.,Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie.  A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion.,After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint.  Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements.  A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length.  0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

Symptomatic fibroid uterus.,PROCEDURE: , Total abdominal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDING:  ,Large fibroid uterus.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for an abdominal procedure.  A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.  This was done without difficulty.  The uterine fundus was then separated from the uterine cervix without difficulty.  This specimen was sent to pathology for identification.  The cervix was then developed with careful dissection.  Jorgenson scissors were then used to remove the cervix from the vaginal cuff.  This was sent to pathology for identification.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  A #1 chromic suture ligature was then used in running fashion at the angles and along the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  Figure-of-eight sutures were then used in an interrupted fashion to close the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  The entire pelvis was washed.  Hemostasis was noted.  The peritoneum was then closed using 2-0 chromic suture ligature in running pursestring fashion.  The rectus abdominis muscles were approximated using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion.  The fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in interlocking running fashion.  Foundation sutures were then placed in an interrupted fashion for further closing the fascia.  The skin was closed with staple gun.  Sponge and needle counts were noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.  Instrument count was noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.  Hemostasis was noted at each level of closure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to recovery room in good condition.obstetrics / gynecology, menometrorrhagia, fibroid, uterus, total abdominal hysterectomy, rectus abdominis muscles, fibroid uterus, suture ligature, therapy, hemostasis, anemia, abdominal,"
1, Bladder Instillation ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today’s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday’s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.urology, urethra, dmso, bladder, chronic interstitial cystitis, interstitial cystitis, bladder instillation, instillation, instillations,"
4," CT Head, Facial Bones, Cervical Spine ","EXAM: , CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.,REASON FOR EXAM:,  A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.,COMPARISONS: , None.,TECHNIQUE: , Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast.  Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.,INTERPRETATIONS:,HEAD:,There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.,FACIAL BONES:,The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.,CERVICAL SPINE:,There is mild generalized osteopenia.  There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation.  The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The central canal is grossly patent.  The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes.  There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified.  The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions.  There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time.  Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications.

She has no exposure to tuberculosis or syphilis, she has no mouth or genital ulcers.  She has no skin rashes.  She has no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measures hand motions on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.consult - history and phy., iritis, nongranulomatous, uveitis, eye inflammation, photophobia, recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis, headache and photophobia, anterior chamber, anterior, chamber, inflammation, "

Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place.  After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty.  With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach.  The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion.  It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration.  Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology.  Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The scope was then slowly removed.  The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis.  The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.,IMPRESSION:,  Abdominal pain.

Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The cheek flap was brought back posteriorly and the cervical flap posteriorly and superiorly with redundant skin on the right massaged and closed.  The skin of the cheek and neck were resected which was redundant after the ***** posteriorly and superiorly in the neck and transversely in the cheek.,Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 PDS suture of deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis of the skin was closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Drains were placed prior to final closure.  A 7-mm flat Jackson-Pratt was then secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Dressing consisting of fluffs and Kerlix and a 4-inch Ace were applied to support mildly compressive dressing.  Scleral eye protectors were removed.  Maxitrol eye ointment was placed followed by Swiss therapy eye pads.

4, Craniotomy - Retrosigmoid  ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100 mL.neurology, neuroma, bergen retractors, emissary veins, mayfield pins, acoustic, acoustic neuroma, cerebellopontine, craniotomy, facial nerve, periauricular, retrosigmoid, retrosigmoid craniotomy, internal auditory canal, porous acusticus, sigmoid sinus, auditory canal, bone, brainstem, nerve, postauricular, tumor"

1, Cheek-Neck Facelift ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Facial and neck skin ptosis.  Cheek, neck, and jowl lipotosis. Facial rhytides.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE: , Temporal cheek-neck facelift (CPT 15825).  Submental suction assisted lipectomy (CPT 15876).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 65-year-old female who has progressive aging changes of the face and neck.  The patient demonstrates the deformities described above and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, risks, limitations, and alternatives in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  The patient has consented to surgery.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started and anesthesia was maintained throughout the case.  The patient was monitored for cardiac, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.,The hair was prepared and secured with rubber bands and micropore tape along the incision line.  A marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incisions, which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus, the post-tragal region, the post auricular region and into the hairline.  In addition, the incision was marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift, then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift.  The incision was marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction.  The incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairline.,The areas to be operated on were injected with 1% Lidocaine containing 1:100,000 Epinephrine.  This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure was maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision was made, as previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors was used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnels from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula was then introduced along these previously outlined tunnels into the jowl on both sides and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnels were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inches of underwater mercury suction was accomplished in all tunnels.  Care was taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it was rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure was performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral areas were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat was then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border was cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl was placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap was then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut was used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound was cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape was placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minutes for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision was started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve was then made, and again the incision was carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicles and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision was carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision was made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair locations and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area was kept deep to the roots of the hair follicles and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle was continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection was brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerves and vessels in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flaps were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pass the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining was connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care was taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection was carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the areas of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis was obtained and all areas inspected.  At no point were muscle fibers or major vessels or nerves encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS was sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap was then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS was split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion was sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS was trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS was then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area was then inspected for any bleeding points and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flaps were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cuts were made and the suspension points in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so as not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scars in the healing period.  Skin closure was accomplished in the hairbearing areas with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area was closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut was used in the post auricular area as well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin was closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure was repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flaps were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid was expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain was placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing was cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze was used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This was wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex was secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branches of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to home in satisfactory condition.cosmetic / plastic surgery, neck skin ptosis, lipotosis, rhytides, facelift, submental suction assisted lipectomy, pre and post auricular, cheek neck facelift, auricular region, neck facelift, cheek neck, post auricular, auricular, incision, postoperative, cheek, submental, dissection, neck, "

The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced.  The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh.  An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle.  The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes.  An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus.  Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels.  An elevator was used to expose the fracture.  The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp.  An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase.  The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction.  A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally.  Excellent stability of fracture was achieved.  Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples.  Dry sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.orthopedic, open reduction and internal fixation, esmarch, internal fixation, malleolus fracture, lateral malleolus, tourniquet, orif, fixation, ankle, reduction, fracture, malleolus"

4, Foreign Body Removal - Foot ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in the right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA and local.,HISTORY:,  This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.

4, Foreign Body Removal - Foot ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in the right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA and local.,HISTORY:,  This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.

Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes.  She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes.  She does experience some leakage with coughing.  She wears the pad on a daily basis.  She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.  With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time.  She reports no headaches at this time.  With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse.  In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs.  She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.  She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.  She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.  She does not use the cane at this time.  Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces.

He comes to my office today continuing on Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2 years.  He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point.  Upon reviewing your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider medication use.  His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time.  His Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5.,I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to continue the Dilantin at this time.  I understand this will probably entail repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center.  I await your response and whether we should continue this medication.  If you require any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling.neurology, eeg, suspected seizure activity, seizure activity, seizure episode, seizure, dilantinNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The patient does have a longstanding history of COPD.  However, she does not use oxygen at her independent assisted living home.  Yesterday, she had made improvement since being here at the hospital.  She needed oxygen.  She was tested for home O2 and qualified for it yesterday also.  Her lungs were very tight.  She did have wheezes bilaterally and rhonchi on the right side mostly.  She appeared to be a bit weak and although she was requesting to be discharged home, she did not appear to be fit for it.,Overnight, the patient needed to use the rest room.  She stated that she needed to urinate.  She awoke, decided not to call for assistance.  She stated that she did have her nurse call light button next to her and she was unable to gain access to her walker.  She attempted to walk to the rest room on her own.  She sustained a fall.  She stated that she just felt weak.  She bumped her knee and her elbow.  She had femur x-rays, knee x-rays also.  There was possibility of subchondral fracture and some swelling of her suprapatellar bursa on the right side.  This morning, she denied any headache, back pain or neck pain.  She complained mostly of right anterior knee pain for which she had some bruising and swelling.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's max temperature over the past 24 hours was 36.5; her blood pressure is 148/77, her pulse is 87 to 106.  She is 95% on 2 L via nasal cannula.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.,LUNGS:  Reveal no expiratory wheezing throughout.

3, Bronchoscopy & Lobectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the left upper lobe.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.  The chest tubes were attached to the Pleur-Evac drainage and placed on suction at this time.  The patient was extubated in the room without difficulty and sent to Recovery in satisfactory.cardiovascular / pulmonary, ng tube, chest tubes, endotracheal tube, pulmonary vein, artery, aspiration, lobectomy, bronchoscopy, tumor, vein, bronchus, pulmonary,"

1, Nephrectomy - Transplant ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rejection of renal transplant.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rejection of renal transplant.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Transplant nephrectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient has had rapid deterioration of her kidney function since her transplant at ABCD one year ago.  The patient was recently thought to have obstruction to the transplant and a stent was placed in to the transplant percutaneously, but the ureter was wide open and there was no evidence of obstruction.  Because the kidney was felt to be irretrievably lost and immunosuppression had been withdrawn, it was elected to go ahead and remove the kidney and hopes that her fever and toxic course could be arrested.,With the patient in the supine position, the previously placed nephrostomy tube was removed.  The patient then after adequate prepping and draping, and placing of a small roll under the right hip, underwent an incision in the direction of the transplant incision down through and through all muscle layers and into the preperitoneal space.  The kidney was encountered and kidney was dissected free of its attachments through the retroperitoneal space.  During the course of dissection, the iliac artery and vein were identified as was the native ureter and the patient's ilioinguinal nerve; all these were preserved.  The individual vessels in the kidney were identified, ligated, and incised, and the kidney was removed.  The ureter was encountered during the course of resection, but was not ligated.  The patient's retroperitoneal space was irrigated with antibiotic solution and #19 Blake drain was placed into the retroperitoneal space, and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  900 mL.surgery, renal transplant, blake drain, rejection, iliac artery, ilioinguinal, immunosuppression, kidney function, nephrectomy, nephrostomy tube, retroperitoneal space, toxic, ureter, vein, transplant, renal, retroperitoneal, kidney, "

Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement.,2.  Anterior acromioplasty.,3.  Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.orthopedic, slap lesion, acromioclavicular joint, impingement syndrome, mumford procedure, acromioplasty, arthroscopy, arthroscopic, arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement, anterior acromioplasty, rotator cuff tear, arthroscopic rotator, meniscal shaver, cuff tear, rotator cuff, debridement, osteoarthritis, acromioclavicular, clavicle, deltoid, rotator, cuff, shoulder, joint"
3," Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 11 ","NAME OF PROCEDURES,1.  Selective coronary angiography.,2.  Left heart catheterization.,3.  Left ventriculography.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The area of the right coronary artery was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Conscious sedation was obtained using a combination of Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  A left #4, 4-French, Judkins catheter was placed and advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery.  Because of difficulty positioning the catheter, the catheter was removed and a 6-French sheath was placed and a 6-French #4 left Judkins catheter was placed.  This was advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  Following this, the 4-French right Judkins catheter was placed and angiograms of the right coronary were performed.  A pigtail catheter was placed and a left heart catheterization was performed, followed by a left ventriculogram.  The left heart pullback was performed.  The catheter was removed and a small injection of contrast was given to the sheath.  The sheath was removed over a wire and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There were no complications.  Total contrast media was 200 mL of Optiray 350.  Fluoroscopy time 5.3 minutes.  Total x-ray dose is 1783 mGy.,HEMODYNAMICS:  ,Rhythm is sinus throughout the procedure.  LV pressure of 155/22 mmHg, aortic pressure of 160/80 mmHg.  LV pullback demonstrates no gradient.,The right coronary artery is a nondominant vessel and free of disease.  This also gives rise to the conus branch and two RV free wall branches.  The left main has minor plaquing in the inferior aspect measuring no more than 10% to 15%.  This vessel then bifurcates into the LAD and circumflex.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel and is dominant.  This vessel gives rise to a large first marginal artery, a moderate sized second marginal branch, and additionally gives rise to a large third marginal artery and the PDA.  There was a very eccentric and severe stenosis in the proximal circumflex measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The origin of the first marginal artery has a severe stenosis measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The distal circumflex has a 60% lesion just prior to the origin of the third marginal branch and PDA.,The proximal LAD is ectatic.  The LAD gives rise to a large first diagonal artery that has a 90% lesion in its origin and a subtotal occlusion midway down the diagonal.  Distal to the origin of this diagonal branch, there is another area of ectasia in the LAD, followed by an area of stenosis that in some views is approximately 50% in severity.,The left ventriculogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.  The overall ejection fraction is preserved.  There is moderate dilatation of the aortic root.  The calculated ejection fraction is 63%.,IMPRESSION,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced by increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall.,2.

2, Death Summary - 2 ,"FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cardiac arrest.,2.  Severe congestive heart failure.,3.  Acute on chronic respiratory failure.,4.  Osteoporosis.,5.  Depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This 92-year-old lady with history of depression and chronic low back pain, osteoporosis, and congestive heart failure, was diagnosed having pneumonia approximately for at least 10 days prior to admission.  In the ER, she was given oral antibiotics.  She also saw me few days before admission coming for a followup.  She was doing fairly well.  She was thought to have congestive heart failure and she was advised to continue with her diuretics.  For the last few days, the patient started to have anorexia, she did not eat well, and she did not drink well.  Her family could not take care of her.  So, she was brought to the emergency room, where she was found to have rapid heart rate with a sinus tachycardia around 112 to 130s.  The ________ was found to be dry.  She was given 1 L of IV fluids and she was subsequently admitted in the hospital for further management.,COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: , The patient stayed in the telemetry.  The patient had significant shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure with bilateral basilar crackles.  She was continued on IV antibiotics and general IV hydration was started initially because of low blood pressure and low perfusion status.  On subsequently improved and stopped and Lasix was started; Dr. X, cardiologist was also placed.  The patient's family wanted her to be a DNR and DNI.  They were allowing us to treat her aggressively medically for pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  However, the patient became extremely weak, mostly unresponsive.  At this time, the patient's family wanted a Hospice consult, which was requested.  By the time the Hospice could evaluate her, the patient's condition got deteriorated, she went into more bradycardiac and hypertension and subsequently expired.

4, Speech Therapy Evaluation ,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Strokes.,SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  ,Global aphasia.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often ""no.""  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded ""no"" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered ""no"" to all ""yes/no"" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated ""I can't"".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple ""yes/no"" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.speech - language, speech automatic tasks, minimal cueing, sentence completion, western aphasia battery, skilled speech therapy, global aphasia, speech therapy, speech, aphasia, "
4, Trabeculectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:, Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, XXX eye 0.3 c per mg times three minutes.,INDICATIONS: ,This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: ,The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.ophthalmology, trabeculectomy, kelly-descemet punch, maxitrol ointment, open angle glaucoma, tg needle, bleeding, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, infection, iridectomy, loss of the eye, loss of vision, mitomycin c, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, temporal paracentesis, worsening of glaucoma, balanced salt solution, anterior chamber, scleral flap, eye, angle, mitomycin, conjunctival, chamber, flap, "

Irrigation and debridement of skin subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and bone, right forearm.,2.  Open reduction, right both bone forearm fracture with placement of long-arm cast.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  25 mL.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient suffered injury at which time he fell over a concrete bench.  He landed mostly on the right arm.  He noted some bleeding at the time of the injury and a small puncture wound.  He was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed a compound both bone forearm fracture, and based on this, he was seen for malalignment.,He was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure was discussed at length with the patient's parents and they understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain on full range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for repeat debridement, risk of need for internal fixation, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  They understood these well.  All questions were answered and they signed the consent for procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The right forearm was inspected.  There was noted to be a 3-mm puncture-type wound over the volar aspect of the forearm in the middle one-third overlying the radial one-half.  There was bleeding in this region.  No gross contamination was seen.  At this point, under fluoroscopic control, I did attempt to see a fracture.  I was unable to do the forearm under the close reduction techniques.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An incision was made through the puncture wound site extending this proximally and distally.  There was noted to be some slight amount of nonviable tissue at the skin edge and debridement was required and performed.  I also did perform a light debridement of the nonviable subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and small bony fragments were also removed.  These were all completely debrided appropriately and then at this point, a thorough irrigation was performed of the radius, which I communicated through the puncture wound.  Both ends were clearly visualized, and thorough irrigation was performed using total of 6 L of antibiotic solution.  All nonviable gross contaminated tissue was removed.  At this point with the bones in direct visualization, I did reduce the bony ends to anatomic alignment with excellent bony approximation.  Proper alignment of tissue and angulation was confirmed.,At this point, under fluoroscopic control confirmed the radius and ulna in anatomic position, which will be completely displaced and shortened previously.  The ulna was now also noted to be in anatomic alignment.,At this point, the region was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis confirmed and closure then begun.  The skin was reapproximated using 3-0 nylon suture.  The visual puncture wound region was left open and this was intact with the depth of the wound down the bone using 1.5-inch Nugauze with iodoform.  Sterile dressing applied and a long-arm cast with the forearm in neutral position was applied.  X-ray with fluoroscopic evaluation was performed, which confirmed.  They maintained excellent bony approximation and the anatomic alignment.  The long-arm cast was then completely mature.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in stable condition.orthopedic, compound fracture, mid-shaft radius, ulna, open reduction, irrigation and debridement, subcutaneous, tissues, muscle, bone, forearm, radius and ulna, forearm fracture, anatomic alignment, arm cast, puncture wound, tourniquet, i&d, fracture,"

Clots partially obstructing the endotracheal tube and completely obstructing the entire left main stem and entire left bronchial system.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Emergent fiberoptic plus bronchoscopy with lavage.,LOCATION OF PROCEDURE:  ,ICU.  Room #164.,ANESTHESIA/SEDATION:,  Propofol drip, Brevital 75 mg, morphine 5 mg, and Versed 8 mg.,HISTORY,:  The patient is a 44-year-old male who was admitted to ABCD Hospital on 09/04/03 status post MVA with multiple trauma and subsequently diagnosed with multiple spine fractures as well as bilateral pulmonary contusions, requiring ventilatory assistance.  The patient was noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray as noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient was subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic as noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope was inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which was partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquots of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope was reinserted on several occasions until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube was noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope was advanced through the distal trachea.  There was a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope was advanced to this region and several aliquots of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several times removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently was advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There was diffuse mucus impactions/tissue as well as intermittent clots.  There was no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope was adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn as the position of endotracheal tube was verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope was then completely withdrawn as the patient was maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.  Throughout the procedure, pulse oximetry was greater than 95% throughout.  There is no hemodynamic instability or variability noted during the procedure.

2, Status Post T&A ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  A 6-year-old boy who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy two weeks ago.  Also, I cleaned out his maxillary sinuses.  Symptoms included loud snoring at night, sinus infections, throat infections, not sleeping well, and fatigue.  The surgery went well, and I had planned for him to stay overnight, but Mom reminds me that by about 8 p.m. the night nurse gotten him to take fluids well and we let him go home then that evening.  He finished up his Augmentin, by a day or two later he was off the Lortab.  Mom has not noticed any unusual voice change.  No swallowing difficulty except he does not like the taste of acidic foods such as tomato sauce.  He has not had any nasal discharge or ever had any bleeding.  He seems to be breathing better.,OBJECTIVE:,  Exam looks good.  The pharynx is well healed.  Tongue mobility is normal.  Voice sounds clear.  Nasal passages reveal no discharge or crusting.,RECOMMENDATION:,  I told Mom it is okay to use some ibuprofen in case his mouth or jaws are still sensitive.  He says it seems to hurt if he opens his mouth real wide such as when he brushes his teeth.  It is okay to chew gum and it is okay to eat crunchy foods such as potato chips.  The pathologist described the expected changes of chronic sinusitis and chronic hypertrophic tonsillitis and adenoiditis, and there were no atypical findings on the laboratories.,I am glad he has healed up well.  There are no other restrictions or limitations.  I told Mom, I had written to Dr. XYZ to let her know of the findings.  The child will continue his regular followup visits with his family doctor, and I told Mom I would be happy to see him anytime if needed.  He did very well after surgery and he seems to feel better and breathe a lot better after his throat and sinus procedure.office notes, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, maxillary, nasal, sinuses,"
1, Thoracentesis - 1 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:  ,Thoracentesis, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the recovery area of the operating room.  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,surgery, malignant pleural effusion, chest wall, pleural effusion, dyspnea, thoracentesis, fluid, pleural, "
2, Q-Fever Endocarditis ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a follow-up visit on this 16-year-old male who is currently receiving doxycycline 150 mg by mouth twice daily as well as hydroxychloroquine 200 mg by mouth three times a day for Q-fever endocarditis.  He is also taking digoxin, aspirin, warfarin, and furosemide.  Mother reports that he does have problems with 2-3 loose stools per day since September, but tolerates this relatively well.  This has not increased in frequency recently.,Mark recently underwent surgery at Children's Hospital and had on 10/15/2007, replacement of pulmonary homograft valve, resection of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, and insertion of Gore-Tex membrane pericardial substitute.  He tolerated this procedure well.  He has been doing well at home since that time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 98.5, pulse 84, respirations 19, blood pressure 101/57, weight 77.7 kg, and height 159.9 cm.,GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Well-developed, well-nourished, slightly obese, slightly dysmorphic male in no obvious distress.,HEENT:  Remarkable for the badly degenerated left lower molar.  Funduscopic exam is unremarkable.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear including the sternal wound.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  A 3/6 systolic murmur heard best over the upper left sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  He does have an enlarged spleen, however, given his obesity, I cannot accurately measure its size.,GU:  Deferred.,EXTREMITIES:  Examination of extremities reveals no embolic phenomenon.,SKIN:  Free of lesions.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly within normal limits.,LABORATORY DATA: , Doxycycline level obtained on 10/05/2007 as an outpatient was less than 0.5.  Hydroxychloroquine level obtained at that time was undetectable.  Of note is that doxycycline level obtained while in the hospital on 10/21/2007 was 6.5 mcg/mL.  Q-fever serology obtained on 10/05/2007 was positive for phase I antibodies in 1/2/6 and phase II antibodies at 1/128, which is an improvement over previous elevated titers.  Studies on the pulmonary valve tissue removed at surgery are pending.,IMPRESSION: , Q-fever endocarditis.,PLAN:  ,1.  Continue doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine.  I carefully questioned mother about compliance and concomitant use of dairy products while taking these medications.  She assures me that he is compliant with his medications.  We will however repeat his hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline levels.,2.  Repeat Q-fever serology.,3.  Comprehensive metabolic panel and CBC.,4.  Return to clinic in 4 weeks.,5.

2, Pain Management Progress Note ,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.soap / chart / progress notes, progress note, management, muscle"
1, Needle Localized Excision - Breast Neoplasm ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Nonpalpable neoplasm, right breast.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Deferred for Pathology.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Needle localized wide excision of nonpalpable neoplasm, right breast.,SPECIMEN: , Mammography.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This 53-year-old Caucasian female who had a nonpalpable neoplasm detected by mammography in the right breast.  After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The incision was closed in two layers.  The first layer consisting of a subcuticular inverted interrupted sutures of #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The second layer consisted of Steri-Strips on the epidermis.  A pressure dressing of fluff, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastic bandage was applied.  The patient tolerated the surgery well.surgery, neoplasm, needle localized wide excision, needle localized, nonpalpable neoplasm, needle, incision, electrocautery, excision, breast "
2, Malignant Meningioma - Consult ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a new patient evaluation for Mr. A. There is a malignant meningioma.  He is referred by Dr. X.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07.  He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently.  He is unable to stand at the moment.  He is unable to care for himself. ,I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day.  His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl.,FINDINGS:,  On examination, he is lying on the stretcher.  He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation.  He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg.  He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.,I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week.  This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema.  This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently.  I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.  I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.  Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest.  I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family.consult - history and phy., seizures, hemiparesis, tumor, seizures hemiparesis, malignant meningioma, chemotherapy, malignant, meningioma, aspirin"

3, Hickman Central Venous Catheter Placement ,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED,1.  Placement of a subclavian single-lumen tunneled Hickman central venous catheter.,2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and anesthesia was administered.  Next, a #18-gauge needle was used to locate the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, a J wire was inserted through the needle using Seldinger technique.  The needle was withdrawn.  The distal tip location of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, a separate stab incision was made approximately 3 fingerbreadths below the wire exit site.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was pulled through the tunnel to the level of the cuff.  The catheter was cut to the appropriate length.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the J wire.  The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the postanesthesia recovery area in good condition.cardiovascular / pulmonary, j wire, distal tip, stab incision, tunneled, hickman central venous catheter, subclavian, venous, fluoroscopy, hickman, catheterNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

Insertion of a **-mm Toronto stentless porcine valve.,2.  Cardiopulmonary bypass.,3.  Cold cardioplegia arrest of the heart.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  , 300 cc.,INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS:  , 1200 cc of crystalloid.,URINE OUTPUT:  , 250 cc.,AORTIC CROSS-CLAMP TIME: , **,CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME TOTAL: , **,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.surgery, cardioplegia, toronto stentless porcine valve, tycron sutures, coronary ostia, porcine valve, retrograde cardioplegia, cardiopulmonary bypass, sutures, valve, insertion, toronto, aortic, stentless, chest, coronary, porcine, cardiopulmonary, prolene, atrial, bypass, heart, aorta,"

1, Pyeloureteroscopy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2, and status post Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6, renal insufficiency, and solitary kidney.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2, and status post Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6, renal insufficiency, and solitary kidney.,PROCEDURE:  ,Cystoscopy under anesthesia, retrograde and antegrade pyeloureteroscopy, left ureteropelvic junction obstruction, difficult and open renal biopsy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthetic with a caudal block x2.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,1000 mL crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 10 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Tissue sent to pathology is a renal biopsy.,ABNORMAL FINDINGS: , A stenotic scarred ureteropelvic junction with dilated ureter and dilated renal pelvis.,TUBES AND DRAINS:  ,A 10-French silicone Foley catheter with 3 mL in balloon and a 4.7-French ureteral double J-stent multilength.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 3-1/2-year-old boy, who has a solitary left kidney with renal insufficiency with creatinine of 1.2, who has had a ureteropelvic junction repair performed by Dr. Chang.  It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.urology, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,"

General anesthesia was begun via face mask technique.  Once an adequate level of anesthesia was obtained, the operating microscope was brought, positioned and visualized the right ear canal.  A small amount of wax was removed with a loop.  A 4-mm operating speculum was then introduced.  An anteroinferior quadrant radial myringotomy was then performed.  A large amount of mucoid middle ear effusion was aspirated from the middle ear cleft.  Reuter bobbin PE tube was then inserted, followed by Floxin otic drops and a cotton ball in the external meatus.  Head was then turned to the opposite side, where similar procedure was performed.  Once again, the middle ear cleft had a mucoid effusion.  A tube was inserted to an anteroinferior quadrant radial myringotomy.,Anesthesia was then reversed and the patient was transported to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well with stable signs.surgery, bilateral myringotomies, insertion of pe tubes, chronic otitis media, conductive hearing loss, recurrent acute otitis media, reuter bobbin, radial myringotomy, ear cleft, pe tubes, middle ear, otitis media, effusion, otitis, media, ear, anesthesia"

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2.  Coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURES: , Robotic-Assisted laparoscopic left renal cyst decortication and cystoscopy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. ABC is a 70-year-old male who has been diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma with multiple renal cysts.  He has undergone MRI of the abdomen on June 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:,1.  Left partial nephrectomy.,2.  Left radical nephrectomy.,3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.  The patient left OR with transfer to the PACU and subsequently to the hospital floor.,The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful.  His diet and activity were gradually advanced without complication.  On postoperative day #2, he was passing flatus and has had bowel movements.  His Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued on postoperative day #3 that being the day of discharge.  His Foley catheter was removed on the morning of discharge and the patient subsequently passed the voiding trial without difficultly.  At the time of discharge, he was afebrile.  His vital signs indicated hemodynamic stability and he had no evidence of infection.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. XYZ on 8/12/2008 at 1:50 p.m. and was given prescription for pain medications as well as laxative.,DISPOSITION: , To home.,DISCHARGE CONDITION:,  Good.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Please see attached medication list.,INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient was instructed to contact Dr. XYZ's office for fever greater than 101.5, intractable pain, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerns.,FOLLOWUP: , The patient will follow up with Dr. XYZ for a postoperative check on 08/12/2008 at 1:50 p.m. and he was made aware of this appointment.nephrology, decortication, cystoscopy, pain, nausea, vomiting, renal cyst decortication, renal cell carcinoma, robotic assisted, renal cyst, renal, robotic, laparoscopic, nephrectomy, cysts, cell, carcinoma, discharge, "

2, Discharge Summary - Respiratory Failure ,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.discharge summary, respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, anasarca, end-stage liver disease, drawn out process, bowel obstruction, blood pressure, dopamine, discharge, "

2, Foot pain Consultation ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Left foot pain.,HISTORY:, XYZ is a basketball player for University of Houston who sustained an injury the day prior. They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. ,PHYSICAL EXAM:, He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender.,RADIOGRAPHS:, Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. ,IMPRESSION:,  Left Chopart joint sprain.,PLAN:,  I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow. He is clear on the prolonged duration of recovery for these hindfoot type injuries.consult - history and phy., foot pain, calcaneocuboid joint, dorsal aspect, dorsal talonavicular joint, foot injuries, hindfoot, midfoot, rehab program, walking boot, weightbearing, talonavicular joint, dorsal, talonavicular, ankle, foot, tenderness"

4, ORIF Mandibular Fracture & Dental Implant Removal ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left atrophic mandibular fracture, removal of failed dental implant from the left mandible.,ANESTHESIA: , General nasotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 125 mL.,FLUIDS GIVEN: , 1 L of crystalloids.,SPECIMEN: , Soft tissue from the fracture site sent for histologic diagnosis.,CULTURES: , Also sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic, culture and sensitivity.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 79-year-old male, who fell in his hometown, following an episode of syncope.  He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.orthopedic, atrophic mandibular fracture, dental implant, open reduction and internal fixation, orif, mandibular fracture, mandible, atrophic, mandibular, dental, implant,"
4, AVM with Hemorrhage ,"CC:, Headache.,HX:, 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of ""migraine"" headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days.,On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a ""whistle."" In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation.,Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease.,On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM.,On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE > LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss.,In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention.,In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ.neurology, arteriovenous malformation, avm, brain ct, cerebral angiogram, headache, audiogram, carotid bruits, difficulty ambulating, hemorrhage, interventricular hemorrhage, migraine, tinnitus, vertigo, visual change, weakness, episode of vertigo, evaluation, "

She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago.  An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube.  She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.,Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor.  We marked external landmarks.  Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area.  This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline.  This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips.  The skin flap was retracted medially.  Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected.  One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was.  The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus.  We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain.  The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor.  Subsequently, we entered the tumor.  The tumor itself was extremely hard.  Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case.  We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor.  Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely.  In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out.  We resected the entire tumor.  Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.,Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam.  We also lined the cavity with Surgicel.  The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.,The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion.  Surgicel was placed over the dural closure.  The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators.  The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples.  The wound was dressed.  The patient was returned to the intensive care unit.  She was awake and moving extremities well.  No apparent complications were noted.  Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure.

Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver.,HISTORY: ,The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition. "
1, Total Knee Arthroplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Right knee total arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , The procedure was done under a subarachnoid block anesthetic in the supine position with a tourniquet utilized.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: , Approximately 90 minutes.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire procedure is done in the inpatient operating suite in the Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  The following sizes of NexGen system were utilized:  E on right femur, cemented; 5 tibial stem tray with a 10 mm polyethylene insert, and a 32 mm patellar button.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 58-year-old white female suffering increasing right knee pain for number of years prior to surgical intervention.  She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this.  They were performed by myself.  She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.  There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time.  A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted.  The ligaments were balanced.  A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed.  Drill hole was made in the distal femur.  The size to an E, right.  Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side.  This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made.  Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out.  There was excellent resection.  It was flat.  Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  Appropriate cuts were carried out.  The standard cut was utilized.,The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws.  Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made.  The cutting guide was then removed.  The bone was removed.  Excess bone was taken out posteriorly.  The posterior capsule was loosened up.  There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened.  Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner.  An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held.  A cut was carried out parallel to the foot.  Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella.  The patella was isolated.  Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off.  The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  The tibial guide was then pinned.  Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella.  The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella.  Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed.  There was excellent ligament balancing.  A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain.  Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch.,Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case.  The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

3, Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal aortic aneurysm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal aortic aneurysm.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,FINDINGS: , The patient was brought to the OR with the known 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm + 2.5 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm.  A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair.  We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm.  The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off.  Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side.  We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area.  It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.,Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally.  The patient was then heparinized.,The 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally.,A stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side.  The calibrated aortogram was the done.  We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries.  We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries.,Once the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery.  As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely.,Following completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately.  A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries.  The area was ballooned aggressively.  It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above.,Following completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas.  Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique.  Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin.,Both surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly.  Meticulous hemostasis was achieved.  Both wounds were then closed in a routine layered fashion.,Sterile antibiotic dressings were applied.  Sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.

4, Laminectomy & Foraminotomy Followup ,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07.,Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain.,She had not improved immediately postoperatively.  She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.,I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well.  She had symptoms of what she thought was ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time.  She has been put on ReQuip for this.,She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative.  She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.,She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively.  The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.,She denies any significant low back pain.  No right lower extremity symptoms.,No infectious symptoms whatsoever.  No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No drainage from the wound.  No difficulties with the incision.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Respirations are normal and nonlabored.  Afebrile to touch.,Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5.  Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5.  This has all been changed compared to preoperatively.  Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5.  Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot.  Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.,The incision is well healed.  There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever.  No drainage.,Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.,Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5.  There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07.  The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.,I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms.  However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection.  I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.,I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.,My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization.  I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time.  She is happy with this.,I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible.  She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested.  I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.,I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve.

4, Iliopsoas Hematoma - 2 ,"CC: ,RLE weakness.,HX: ,This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8.,On 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization.

The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.,Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.orthopedic, plantar condyle hypertrophy, condyle hypertrophy, subcutaneous tissues, ankle tourniquet, metatarsophalangeal joint, metatarsal head, plantar condylectomy, tourniquet, condylectomy, plantar, ankle, metatarsal,"

The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.

1, Colonoscopy - 3 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prior history of neoplastic polyps.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Small rectal polyps/removed and fulgurated.,PREMEDICATIONS:,  Prior to the colonoscopy, the patient complained of a sever headache and she was concerned that she might become ill.  I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV.,Following the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction.  She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV.  Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved.  She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation.  Rectal exam revealed no external lesions.  Digital exam revealed no mass.,REPORTED PROCEDURE:,  The P160 colonoscope was used.  The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum.  Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult.  Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend.  With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum.  The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal.  The sigmoid colon was likewise normal.  There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum.  One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery.  There was no specimen because the polyps were so small.  The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.,ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:,1.

1, Cryosurgical Ablation of Prostate ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate.,FINDINGS:  ,After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone.  Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.  The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.urology, carcinoma of the prostate, ablation, cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation, prostate, ultrasound, cryosurgical, urethra, "
1, Shunt Revision - 3 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,PROCEDURE: , Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , The patient is nonverbal.  He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.surgery, bactiseal, bactiseal catheter, codman bactiseal, blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt, ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt revision, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, catheter, ventriculoperitoneal, ventricular, shunt"
3, Sleep Difficulties ,"CLINICAL HISTORY: , This is a 16-year-old man evaluated for sleep difficulties.  He states he is ""feeling bad in the mornings"" that he has daytime somnolence and ""whenever I wake up I experience dizziness, weakness, stomachache, loss of appetite, drowsiness, overall sore body and a general feeling of unwell.""  He does state that he has only rarely he got anything suggestive of restless leg syndrome, is unaware of any apnea or like symptoms.  He has a mouth breather.  He states he wakens up during the night, usually goes to bed at 10 to 11, gets up at 7 to 7:30.  In the weekends, he stays up late and sleeps until 1 in the afternoon.  He lists sporadic use of melatonin and Benadryl, and Tylenol PM for sleep.  His other medicines are Accutane, Nasonex and oxymetazoline.  There is no smoking, no alcohol intake.  He does have three caffeinated beverages a week.  He is 75 inches, 185 pounds, BMI 23.1.  He rated himself 4/7 on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale at the onset of the study and 6 on the Epworth Sleeping Scale, said that his night sleep in the lab was characterized by a longer than usual sleep onset latency with more arousals than usual.  He woke up feeling equally rested and the only comment he made on the post sleep questionnaire was ""some of the wires"" is the source of problems.,TECHNIQUE: , The study was performed with the following parameters measured throughout the entirety of the recording:,Electroencephalogram, electromyogram of the chin and lower extremities, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, air flow from the nose and mouth, respiratory effort at the chest and abdomen, and finger oximetry.,The record was scored for sleep and the various other parameters in 30-second epochs.,RESULTS: , This study was performed in 61 minutes in duration during which he slept 432 minutes after 19 minutes sleep onset latency; thereafter, he had 10 awakenings for 6 minutes of wakefulness giving him a normal sleep efficiency of 95%.  Sleep staging was actually fairly deep and normal for age with 5% stage I, 51% stage II, 22% slow wave sleep and 22% REM.  He had 5 REM periods during the night.  The first beginning 66 minutes after sleep onset.  He did have 63 arousals, giving him a borderline elevated arousal index of 8.8, 16 were driven by limb movements, 41 of unclear origin, 6 from hypopneas.,EEG PARAMETERS: , No abnormalities.,EKG PARAMETERS: , Normal sinus rhythm, mean rate 76, no ectopics noted.,EMG PARAMETERS: , 88 PLMs were noted.

The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

4, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 1 ,"REASON FOR EVALUATION: , The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.,He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.,With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.,DRUG HISTORY:,  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.,PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: , The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.  We have talked to her.  She is very supportive.  His only sister is also very supportive of him.  He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past.  He has done poorly in some of them.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,  The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person.  His affect is flat.  He talked about auditory hallucinations, which are equivocal in nature.  He is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home.  His voice and speech are normal.  He believes in telepathy.  His memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,AXIS I:  Schizophrenia.,AXIS II:  Deferred.,AXIS III:  History of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic bronchitis.,AXIS IV:  Moderate.,AXIS V:  GAF of 35 on admission.,INITIAL TREATMENT AND PLAN:,  Since, the patient has been on high dosages of medications, we will give him a holiday and a structured environment.  We will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision anti-psychotic later.  We will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well.neurology, neuropsychological, gaf, schizophrenia, anti-psychotic, chronic psychotic condition, delusions, hallucination, homicidal, marijuana, psychological, psychotic, smokes cigarettes, smoking, neuropsychological evaluation, clozaril, bronchitis, axis, "

Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient was placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tones were checked and were 140s, and she was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia was nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia was grasped, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade was inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum was tented up and a bladder flap was created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade was reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision was extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid was noted.  Infant's head was in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant was delivered atraumatically.  The infant was very pale upon delivery.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube was doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gases were obtained.  Cord was then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood was drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it was noted that the cord was significantly yellow stained as well as the placenta.  At this time, the placenta was delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus was exteriorized and cleared off all clots and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment was closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two areas of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight sutures were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision was hemostatic.  The bladder was examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovaries were examined and found to be normal.  The patient was again asked if she desires permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube was identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube was doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis was noted.  Then, attention was turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion was grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Attention was returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus was returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clots and debris.  Lower uterine segments were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum was grasped with Kelly clamps x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation was used.  Rectus muscle belly was examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation was again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x3 and the patient was sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.  If she continues to have pain, may need a surgical consult for gallbladder and/or angiogram for evaluation of right kidney and questionable venous plexus.

4, Hip Fracture - ER Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Left hip fracture.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a pleasant 53-year-old female with a known history of sciatica, apparently presented to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left lower extremity and unable to bear weight.  History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.orthopedic, calcar, proximal femur, pathological fracture, hip, fracture, hemiarthroplasty, melanoma, "

Plan is for repair of both.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal.  The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture.  This was done twice.  The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision.  The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field.  The sac was then opened completely around the testis.  The appendix testis was cauterized.  We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture.  Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely.  Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure.  Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.surgery, bilateral hydrocele repair, bilateral inguinal hernia, external oblique fascia, ilioinguinal nerve block, bilateral hydroceles, external oblique, oblique fascia, cord structures, hydrocele sac, lord maneuver, nerve block, bilateral inguinal, ilioinguinal nerve, inguinal hernia, hernia, inguinal, hydrocele, bilateral, sac,"
1, Wrist Ganglion Excision ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Wrist ganglion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Wrist ganglion.,TITLE OF PROCEDURE: , Excision of dorsal wrist ganglion.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I made a transverse incision directly over the ganglion.  Dissection was carried down through the extensor retinaculum, identifying the 3rd and the 4th compartments and retracting them.  I then excised the ganglion and its stalk.  In addition, approximately a square centimeter of the dorsal capsule was removed at the origin of stalk, leaving enough of a defect to prevent formation of a one-way valve.  We then identified the scapholunate ligament, which was uninjured.  I irrigated and closed in layers and injected Marcaine with epinephrine.  I dressed and splinted the wound.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.surgery, origin of stalk, extensor retinaculum, wrist ganglion, incision, excision, dorsal, tourniquet, wrist, ganglion"
4, Electroencephalography ,"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.neurology, electroencephalography, eeg, hz rhythm, parkinson's tremor, photic stimulation, frontal head region, temporal head region, muscle contractions, seizures, parkinson's, temporal, "

4, Phacoemulsification & Lens Implantation - 4 ,"OPERATION PERFORMED:, Phacoemulsification of cataract and posterior chamber lens implant, right eye., ,ANESTHESIA:, Retrobulbar nerve block, right eye, ,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where local anesthetic was administered to the right eye followed by a dilute drop of Betadine and a Honan balloon.  Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was taken from the operating room in good condition.ophthalmology, retrobulbar nerve block, posterior chamber lens implant, phacoemulsification of cataract, lens implantation, capsular bag, cataract, phacoemulsification, nucleus, capsular, lens, eye"

Multisequence, multiplanar images of the orbits/face/neck were obtained with and without contrast.  0.5 ml Magnevist was used as the intravenous contrast agent.,2.  MR angiography of the head was obtained using a time-of-flight technique.,3.  The patient was under general anesthesia during the exam.,FINDINGS:,  MRI orbits/face/neck:  There is a pedunculated mass measuring 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm arising from the patient's lip on the right side.  The mass demonstrates a heterogeneous signal.  There is also heterogeneous enhancement which may relate to a high vascular tumor given the small amount of contrast for the exam.  The origin of the mass from the upper lip demonstrates intact soft tissue planes.,Limited evaluation of the head demonstrates normal appearing midline structures.  Incidental note is made of a small arachnoid cyst within the anterior left middle cranial fossa.  The mastoid air cells on the right are opacified; while the left demonstrates appropriate aeration.,MR angiography of the head:  Angiography is limited such that the vessel feeding the mass cannot be identified with certainty.  The right external carotid artery is noted to be asymmetrically larger than the left, the phenomenon likely related to provision of feeding vessels to the mass.  There is no carotid stenosis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  The mass arising from the right upper lip measures 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm with a heterogeneous appearance and enhancement pattern.  Hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis as well as other mesenchymal neoplasms.,2.

The patient suffered neurologic devastation.  In order to facilitate enteral feedings, the plan is to place a G-tube as the patient cannot take by mouth.  Consent was obtained by court order as the patient is a ward of the state.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made through the umbilicus.  Peritoneal cavity entered bluntly.  A 5-mm trocar was introduced.  Abdomen was insufflated with a 5-mm scope.  No obvious pathology noted.  We visualized the stomach.  We chose the spot in the left upper quadrant for future G-tube site.  I made a small incision on the skin there, put another 5-mm trocar at that site.  Using a Babcock, we grasped the stomach along the greater curvature site for further G-tube.  I pulled a knuckle of stomach through the incision and secured with 4-0 Vicryl.  I then used 3-0 Prolene sutures as tacking sutures on either side of the future G-tube site taking full-thickness abdominal wall through stomach and back out the abdominal wall.  I then pulled the knuckle of stomach back up through the incision, made a gastrotomy, and then put a 4-0 pursestring around the gastrotomy site, introduced the 14, 1.2- cm MIC-Key into the stomach.  The gastrotomy site insufflated with 5 mL of saline.  We then tied down the pursestring.  On the laparoscopy, the G-tube looked to be in good position.  I insufflated the stomach through the G-tube, which I did and removed air subsequently.  I then placed 2 x 2 underneath the G-tube and tied down tacking sutures around the G-tube itself, placed the G-tube to gravity, desufflated the abdomen, closed the umbilical port site fascia with 3-0 Vicryl, closed skin with 5-0 Monocryl, and dressed with bacitracin, 2 x 2, and Steri-Strips.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken back to recovery room.

Additionally, there was a notable liver cyst.  The remainder of the abdomen remained free of any adhesions.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 66-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.  The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stones were visualized.  Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This was also taken and sent off as specimen.  The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  The abdomen was de-insufflated.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  All incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures.  The areas were cleaned and dried.  Steri-Strips were placed.  On the incisions, sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following procedure.  She is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with Dr. X within one week for a follow-up evaluation.gastroenterology, excision of liver cyst, gallbladder, omentum, cystic artery, gallstone, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, liver cyst, liver, abdomen, electrocautery, cholelithiasis, cholecystectomy, adhesions, laparoscopic, cyst, cystic, "
1, Circumcision - 3 ,"CIRCUMCISION,After informed consent was obtained the baby was placed on the circumcision tray.  He was prepped in a sterile fashion times 3 with Betadine and then draped in a sterile fashion.  Then 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected at 10 and 2 o'clock.  A ring block was also done using another 0.3 mL of lidocaine.  Glucose water is also used for anesthesia.  After several minutes the curved clamp was attached at 9 o'clock with care being taken to avoid the meatus.  The blunt probe was then introduced again with care taken to avoid the meatus.

4," CT Head, Facial Bones, Cervical Spine ","EXAM: , CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.,REASON FOR EXAM:,  A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.,COMPARISONS: , None.,TECHNIQUE: , Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast.  Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.,INTERPRETATIONS:,HEAD:,There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.,FACIAL BONES:,The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.,CERVICAL SPINE:,There is mild generalized osteopenia.  There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation.  The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The central canal is grossly patent.  The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes.  There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified.  The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions.  There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time.  Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications.  The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated.,2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain.,3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture.,4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.,5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation.orthopedic, sagittal, coronal, soft tissue swelling, paranasal sinuses, mastoid air, acute fracture, maxillary sinuses, tissue swelling, underlying fracture, multilevel degenerative, ct head, soft tissue, facial bones, cervical spine, ct, facial, bones, spine, cervical"

Intraoperative programming and assessment of device.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor.  The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation.  The procedure is discussed below.,I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition.  She was placed on the operating table in seated position.  Her head was shaved.  Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken.  The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint.  Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.,The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit.  At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill.  The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  Microelectrode recording was then performed.  The signatures of the cells were recognized.  Microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  The microelectrode unit was then remounted.  Microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  The arc was then removed.  A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used.  Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The Leksell arc was then removed.,She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.

Need for durable central intravenous access.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.cardiovascular / pulmonary, lumbar osteomyelitis, central intravenous access, subclavian, osteomyelitis, broviac catheter, catheter, toddler, intravenous,"

Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required.  Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,In the right flank-up position, table was flexed.  He had a Foley catheter in place.  Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter.  The umbilical hernia was taken down.  An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin.  A liver retractor was placed to this.,The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt.  The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly.  The vena cava was identified.  The main renal vein was identified.  Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided.  Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie.  The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally.  Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided.  Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.,Hemostasis was excellent.,The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down.  The edges were freshened up.  Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar.,Skin closed with clips.,He tolerated the procedure well.

After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The incision was closed in two layers.  The first layer consisting of a subcuticular inverted interrupted sutures of #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The second layer consisted of Steri-Strips on the epidermis.

2, Nephrolithiasis - Progress Note ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.,ALLERGIES: , Sulfa.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  As I have given are Levaquin, Prinivil 20 mg a day, Bumex 0.5 mg a day, Levsinex 0.375 mg a day, cimetidine 400 mg a day, potassium chloride 8 mEq a day, and atenolol 25 mg a day.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She says she is voiding okay.

4, Craniotomy - Biparietal  ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm.,TITLE OF THE OPERATION:,1.  Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.,2.  Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance.,3.  Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.,4.  Microtechniques for all the above.,5.  Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.,Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.neurology, metastatic lesion, biparietal, mayfield head holder, microtechniques, stealth, craniotomy, excision, fiducial, infratentorial, parietooccipital, stereotactic, suboccipital, subtentorial, ventriculostomy, lesions to the brain, removal of the tumor, parietal occipital region, running locking nylon, biparietal craniotomy, posterior fossa, tumor, brain, dura, lesions, "
1, Total Thyroidectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Thyroid goiter with substernal extension on the left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Thyroid goiter with substernal extension on the left.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Total thyroidectomy with removal of substernal extension on the left.,THIRD ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 200 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 54-year-old Caucasian male with a history of an enlarged thyroid gland who presented to the office initially with complaints of dysphagia and some difficulty in breathing while lying supine.  The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

4, EEG ,"DIAGNOSIS:,  Possible cerebrovascular accident.,DESCRIPTION: , The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages.  The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically.  A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session.  Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen.,IMPRESSION: , Mildly abnormal study.  The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder.  Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated.  Clinical correlation is recommended.neurology, scalp-to-scalp, scalp-to-vertex, montages, electrodes, amplitude, epileptiform activity, cerebrovascular accident, eegNOTE"

The patient is also ventilator-dependent, respiratory failure with tracheostomy in place and dependent on parenteral nutrition secondary to dysphagia and also has history of protein-calorie malnutrition and the patient needs to receive total parenteral nutrition and therefore needs central venous access.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient's legal guardian was talked to.  All questions were answered and consent was obtained.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped.  Approximately 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected into the inguinal site.  A strong femoral artery pulse was felt and triple lumen catheter Angiocath was inserted at 30-degree angle cephalad and aspirated until a dark venous blood was aspirated.  A guidewire was then placed through the needle.  The needle was then removed.  The skin was ________ at the base of the wire and a dilator was placed over the wire.  The triple lumen catheters were then flushed with bacteriostatic saline.  The dilator was then removed from the guidewire and a triple lumen catheter was then inserted over the guidewire with the guidewire held at all times.,The wire was then carefully removed.  Each port of the lumen catheter was aspirated with 10 cc syringe with normal saline till dark red blood was expressed and then flushed with bacteriostatic normal saline and repeated on the remaining two ports.  Each port was closed off and also kept off.  Straight needle suture was then used to suture the triple lumen catheter down to the skin.  Peristatic agent was then placed at the site of the lumen catheter insertion and a Tegaderm was then placed over the site.  The surgical site was then sterilely cleaned.

1, Consult - Prostate Cancer ,"CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCER,The patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence.  These were discussed at length.  Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.  I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available.  I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options.urology, prostate cancer, cryosurgery, hdr radiation, prostate surgery, bladder, bleeding, bowel, consultation, impotence, incontinence, infection, prostatectomy, radiation therapy, radical, rectal, rectal fistula, rectal injury, prostate cancer consult, cancer, radiation, prostateNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

4, Phacoemulsification of Cataract ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Cataract, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Cataract, right eye.,PROCEDURE:, Right phacoemulsification of cataract with intraocular lens implantation.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, Under topical anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care, the patient was prepped, draped and positioned under the operating microscope. A lid speculum was applied to the right eye, and a stab incision into the anterior chamber was done close to the limbus at about the 1 o'clock position with a Superblade, and Xylocaine 1% preservative free 0.25 mL was injected into the anterior chamber, which was then followed by Healon to deepen the anterior chamber. Using a keratome, another stab incision was done close to the limbus at about the 9 o'clock position and with the Utrata forceps, anterior capsulorrhexis was performed, and the torn anterior capsule was totally removed. Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were performed with the tuberculin syringe filled with BSS. The tip of the phaco unit was introduced into the anterior chamber, and anterior sculpting of the nucleus was performed until about more than two-thirds of the nucleus was removed. Using the phaco tip and the Drysdale hook, the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces and then phacoemulsified.,The phaco tip was then exchanged for the aspiration/irrigation tip, and cortical materials were aspirated. Posterior capsule was polished with a curette polisher, and Healon was injected into the capsular bag. Using the Monarch intraocular lens inserter, the posterior chamber intraocular lens model SN60WF power +19.50 was placed into the inserter after applying some Healon, and the tip of the inserter was gently introduced through the cornea tunnel wound, into the capsular bag and then the intraocular lens was then inserted inferior haptic first into the back and the superior haptic was placed into the bag with the same instrument. Intraocular lens was then rotated about half a turn with a collar button hook. Healon was removed with the aspiration/irrigation tip, and balanced salt solution was injected through the side port to deepen the anterior chamber. It was found that there was no leakage of fluid through the cornea tunnel wound. For this reason, no suture was applied. Vigamox, Econopred and Nevanac eye drops were instilled and the eye was covered with a perforated shield. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

3, Fundoplication & Gastrostomy Followup ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.gastroenterology, decannulation, enteral feeding, feeding access, laparoscopic fundoplication, gastrostomy, airway, laryngotracheoplasty, laparoscopic, fundoplication, "
1, Salvage Cystectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Radiation cystitis.,2.  Refractory voiding dysfunction.,3.  Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Radiation cystitis.,2.  Refractory voiding dysfunction.,3.  Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal with epidural.,INDICATIONS:  ,This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.surgery, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, omental pedicle flap, ligasure, gia, stapler, gia stapler, vicryl sutures, radiation therapy, silk sutures, bladder, therapy, sutures, endotracheal, "

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.,DE QUERVAIN'S RELEASE: , With the patient under adequate regional anesthesia applied by surgeon using 1% plain Xylocaine, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was then made over the radial aspect of the wrist overlying the first dorsal tunnel.  Using blunt dissection, the radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The first dorsal tunnel was then identified.  The first dorsal tunnel was incised along the dorsal ulnar border, completely freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (de Quervain's release).  EPB and APL tendons were inspected and found to be completely free.  The radial sensory nerve was inspected and found to be without damage.,The skin was closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch and Steri-Strips were applied and, over the Steri-Strips, a sterile dressing, and, over the sterile dressing, a volar splint with the hand in safe position.

2, Pulmonary Hypertension - Pediatric Consult ,"INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION: , Increasing oxygen requirement.,HISTORY: , Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.consult - history and phy., high-frequency ventilator, structural anatomy, foramen ovale, oxygen requirement, hypertension, pulmonary "

Empyema of the chest, left.,PROCEDURES,1.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy.,2.  Limited left thoracotomy with partial pulmonary decortication and insertion of chest tubes x2.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy.  Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope.  Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems.  Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy.  He was properly draped.  I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.  Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest.  We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.  Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung.  We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.  Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure.  On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations.  We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex.,The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.  Then, the patient was transported.,Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.  A chest x-ray was ordered stat.surgery, chest tubes, insertion, partial pulmonary decortication, thoracotomy, bronchoscopy, empyema, bronchopneumonia, diagnostic bronchoscopy, pulmonary decortication, bilateral bronchopneumonia, decortication, intercostal, pulmonary, tubes,"

One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.surgery, austin-akin bunionectomy, weil osteotomy, internal screw fixation, first right metatarsal, metatarsophalangeal joint, hammertoe deformity, extensor digitorum longus, austin akin bunionectomy, threaded cannulated screw, semi elliptical incisions, ankle tourniquet, surgical neck, cannulated screws, pip joint, proximal phalanx, fixation, metatarsophalangeal, proximal, screw, metatarsal, osteotomy, austin, joint, tourniquet, osteomed, phalanx, incision, "

A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed.

1, PMT Halo Crown & Vest ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Application of PMT large halo crown and vest.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.  Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes.  Post-fixation neurologic examination normal.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.neurosurgery, cervical spondylosis, anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression, fusion, pmt, crown, vest, pmt halo, cervical,"

4, Total Knee Arthroplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Right knee total arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , The procedure was done under a subarachnoid block anesthetic in the supine position with a tourniquet utilized.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: , Approximately 90 minutes.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire procedure is done in the inpatient operating suite in the Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  The following sizes of NexGen system were utilized:  E on right femur, cemented; 5 tibial stem tray with a 10 mm polyethylene insert, and a 32 mm patellar button.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 58-year-old white female suffering increasing right knee pain for number of years prior to surgical intervention.  She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this.  They were performed by myself.  She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.  There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time.  A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted.  The ligaments were balanced.  A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed.  Drill hole was made in the distal femur.  The size to an E, right.  Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side.  This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made.  Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out.  There was excellent resection.  It was flat.  Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  Appropriate cuts were carried out.  The standard cut was utilized.,The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws.  Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made.  The cutting guide was then removed.  The bone was removed.  Excess bone was taken out posteriorly.  The posterior capsule was loosened up.  There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened.  Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner.  An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held.  A cut was carried out parallel to the foot.  Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella.  The patella was isolated.  Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off.  The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  The tibial guide was then pinned.  Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella.  The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella.  Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed.  There was excellent ligament balancing.  A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain.  Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch.,Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case.  The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.orthopedic, arthroplasty, knee, degenerative osteoarthritis, subcutaneous, osteoarthritis, degenerative, tourniquet, drill,"
4, Psychological Testing ,"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:,  Mr. Abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a depression, or a Bipolar Spectrum Disorder.  The information will be used for treatment planning.,BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Mr. Abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  He has been married since 1995 and lost a son to SIDS over seven years ago.  He served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at UAA.  He still wants to get a degree in engineering.  Mr. Abcd indicated that he did use THC at the time of his initial intake with me in January 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as I am aware.  He has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife's significant health problems.  He also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  He has received counseling in the past, and did try both Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in October 2005.  He indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  He indicated that he thought he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  There is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  A recent stressor involved OCS involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for THC.  So far as I am aware, this case is closed at this time.  ,BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:,  Mr. Abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  Mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  Affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  Speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  He was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  The results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed.,ASSESSMENT RESULTS:,  Mr. Abcd's responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F'+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  Posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the MMPI-2.,SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:,psychiatry / psychology, psychological testing, adhd, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar spectrum disorder, cpt-ii, mmpi-2, posttraumatic stress disorder, welsh code, depression, psychological assessment, personality disorder, family stressors, posttraumatic stress, disorder, attention, psychological, "

Venography.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was attempted to be punctured but unsuccessfully.  Approximately 10 cc of intravenous contrast was injected into the left upper extremity peripheral vein.  Venogram was then performed.  Under fluoroscopy via modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was punctured and a guidewire was passed through the vein into the superior vena cava, then the right atrium and then into the inferior vena cava.  A second guidewire was placed in a similar fashion.  Approximately a 5 cm incision was made in the left upper anterior chest.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected out of the prepectoral fascia.  Both guide wires were brought into the pocket area.  A sheath was placed over the lateral guidewire and fluoroscopically guided to the vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  A Fixation ventricular lead, under fluoroscopic guidance, was placed through the sheath into the superior vena cava, right atrium and then right ventricle.  Using straight and curved stylettes, it was placed in position and screwed into the right ventricular apex.  After pacing and sensing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  A guide sheath was placed over the guidewire and fluoroscopically placed in the superior vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  An Active Fixation atrial lead was fluoroscopically passed through the sheath, into the superior vena cava and then the right atrium.  Using straight and J-shaped stylettes, it was placed in the appropriate position and screwed in the right atrial appendage area.  After significant pacing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscles with Ethibond suture.  The tract was flushed with saline solution.  A Medtronic pulse generator was attached to both the leads and fixed to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  Deep and superficial layers were closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Steri-strips were placed over the incision.  Tegaderm was placed over the Steri-strips.

Peripheral vascular disease.,OPERATIONS,1.  Wound debridement with removal of Surgisis xenograft and debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue.,2.  Secondary closure of wound, complicated.,3.  VAC insertion.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where a general anesthetic was given.  A time-out process was followed.  All the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with Betadine soap and then painted with Betadine solution and draped in usual fashion.,The xenograft was not adhered at all and was easily removed.  There was some, what appeared to be a seropurulent exudate at the bottom of the incision.  This was towards the abdominal end, under the xenograft.,The graft was fully exposed and it was pulsatile.  We then proceeded to use a pulse spray with bacitracin clindamycin solution to clean up the graft.  A few areas of necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided.  Prior to this, samples were taken for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.,Normal saline 3000 cc was used for the irrigation and at the end of that the wound appeared much cleaner and we proceeded to insert the sponges to put a VAC system to it.  There was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the VAC in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound.  Prior to that, I had inserted a number of Vesseloops through the edges of the skin and I proceeded to approximate those on top of the VAC sponge.  Multiple layers were applied to seal the system, which was suctioned and appeared to be working satisfactorily.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the ICU for recovery.surgery, open wound, prosthetic vascular graft, closure of wound, surgisis, peripheral vascular disease, wound debridement, subcutaneous tissue, vac insertion, wound, betadine, debridement, xenograft, insertion,"
1, Hemangioma Debulking & Rhinoplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hemangioma, nasal tip.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Hemangioma, nasal tip.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,1.  Debulking of hemangioma of the nasal tip through an open rhinoplasty approach.,2.  Rhinoplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,FINDINGS: , Large hemangioma involving the midline of the columella separated the lower lateral cartilages at a level of the columella and the nasal domes.,CONDITION:  ,Condition of the patient at end of the procedure stable, transferred to recovery room.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 2-year-old female with a history of a nasal tip hemangioma.  The hemangioma has involved at her upper tongue.  There has not been any change in the last 6 months.  We have discussed with the parents the situation and decided to proceed with the debulking of the nasal tip hemangioma.  They understand the nature of the incision, the nature of the surgery, and the possibility of future revision surgeries.  They understand the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery, and minor asymmetry.  They wished to proceed with surgery.,Because of the procedure, informed consent is obtained.  The patient is taken to operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic is administrated to an oroendotracheal tube.  The face is prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The incision is designed to the lower aspect of the hemangioma, which corresponds to the columella and upper lip junction and then the remaining of the incision is designed as an open rhinoplasty with bilateral rim incisions.  The area is infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine.  We waited 7 minutes for the hemostatic effect and proceeded with the incision.  The incision was then done with a 15 C blade starting at the columella and then going laterally to the level of the rim and the double hook is placed at the level of the dome and the intracartilage incision is done through the mucosa, then extended laterally and upward to follow the lower lateral cartilage.  This is done in both sides.  Further incision is done.  A small tenotomy scissors is used and with the help of retraction of the lower lateral cartilage, the hemangioma is separated gently from the lower lateral cartilage on both sides and I proceeded to leave that the central part of the incision lifting up the entire columella to the level of the nasal tip.  The hemangioma is removed and is found to be involving the medial aspects of both medial crura.  This gently separated from the medial crura and from the soft tissue care is taken not to remove the entire hemangioma from the skin as the nose not to devascularize the distal columella portion.  Hemostasis is achieved with electrocautery.  Then, we proceed to place some interdomal stitches with the help of a 6-0 clear nylon and intercrural stitches are placed and then an interdomal stitch, a single one was placed.  The skin is redraped and the nose found to have satisfactory shape.  The columellar piece was tailored on the lateral aspect corresponding to rim incisions to match the newly created width of the columella.  Portions of skin and hemangioma are taken laterally on both sides of the columella distally.  The skin was closed with 6-0 mild chromic stitches, including the portion at the level of the columella and rim incisions medially.  The remaining of the internal incisions are closed with 5-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The nose is irrigated and suctioned.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.

4, Rolandic Epilepsy ,"City, State,Dear Dr. Y:,I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z.  His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.  To review, his birth was unremarkable.  He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female.  He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade.  He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age.  It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep.  He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching.  His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere).  Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.,ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal.  He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures.  His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication.  That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes.  He has done well otherwise.  Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration.  He has not had any behavior issues.  He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities.  He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents.  Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms.  Mother is an 8th grade teacher.,Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known.  There is no other relevant family history.,Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation.  This is perhaps due to sports injury.  He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted.  He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities.  He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills.  He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints.,Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.,Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  His weight today is 80.6 pounds.  Height is 58-1/4 inches.  Blood pressure 113/66.  Head circumference 36.3 cm.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.  NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.  CHEST:  Clear auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented.  His cognitive skills appear normal for his age.  His speech is fluent and goal-directed.  He follows instructions well.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation.  Palate elevates midline.  Tongue protrudes midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone.  Sensation intact to light touch and vibration.  His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem.  Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.,IMPRESSION:  ,This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic.  Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006.  The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal.  At that time, he will be tapered off of medication.  I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication.  For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him.  There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased.  Family understands the plan.  We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months.  Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results.,Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management.neurology, tonic-clonic seizures, benign rolandic epilepsy, rolandic epilepsy, epilepsy, seizures, electroencephalogram,"

Hiatal hernia.,3.  Enterogastritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, photography, and biopsy.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient has a history of epigastric abdominal pain, persistent in nature.  She has a history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, takes Pepcid frequently.  She has had a history of hiatal hernia.  She is being evaluated at this time for disease process.  She does not have much response from Protonix.,Upon endoscopy, the gastroesophageal junction is approximately 40 cm.  There appeared to be some inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction and a small 1 cm to 2 cm hiatal hernia.  There is no advancement of the gastric mucosa up into the lower one-third of the esophagus.  However there appeared to be inflammation as stated previously in the gastroesophageal junction.  There was some mild inflammation at the antrum of the stomach.  The fundus of the stomach was within normal limits.  The cardia showed some laxity to the lower esophageal sphincter.  The pylorus is concentric.  The duodenal bulb and sweep are within normal limits.  No ulcers or erosions.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient is taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position.  The patient was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed.  Olympus videoscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and upon deglutition passed into the esophagus.  Using air insufflation, panendoscope was advanced down the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and sweep and the above gross findings were noted.  Panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel.  Photographs were taken with the pathology present.  Biopsy was obtained of the antrum of the stomach and also CLO test.  The biopsy is also obtained of the gastroesophageal junction at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions to rule out occult Barrett's esophagitis.  Air was aspirated from the stomach and the panendoscope was removed.

1, Right Shoulder Hemiarthroplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right shoulder rotator cuff tear.,2.  Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy.,3.  Degenerative joint disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right shoulder rotator cuff tear.,2.  Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy.,3.  Degenerative joint disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Right shoulder hemiarthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 125 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,COMPONENTS: , A DePuy 10 mm global shoulder system stem was used cemented and a DePuy 44 x 21 mm articulating head was used.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is an 82-year-old right-hand dominant female who presents for shoulder pain for many years now and affecting her daily living and function and pain is becoming unbearable failing conservative treatment.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the operative field.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.surgery, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "
1, Salpingooophorectomy - Laparoscopic ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right pelvic pain.,2.  Right ovarian mass.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right pelvic pain.,2.  Right ovarian mass.,3.  8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General with endotracheal tube.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 cc.,TUBES: , None.,DRAINS:,  None.,PATHOLOGY: , The right tube and ovary sent to pathology for review.,FINDINGS: , On exam under anesthesia, a normal-appearing vulva and vagina and normally palpated cervix, a uterus that was normal size, and a large right adnexal mass.  Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.  ,Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dressings were changed.  The weighted speculum was removed from the patient's cervix.  The cervix noted to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the Recovery in stable condition. "
2, Progress Note - Liver Cirrhosis ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.soap / chart / progress notes, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, liver disease, epigastric pain, liver cirrhosis, liver, abdominal, cirrhosis, epigastric, hepatitis,"
1, Intramedullary Rod ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture.,OPERATION: , Intramedullary rod in the left hip using the Synthes trochanteric fixation nail measuring 11 x 130 degrees with an 85-mm helical blade.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:,  None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  50 mL.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient suffered a fall at which time she was taken to the emergency room with pain in the lower extremities.  She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult.  With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well.,Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment.  External positions were felt to be present.  At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire.  An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths.  A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth.  Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted.  A small incision was made for this as well.  A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP.  This placed the proper depths and lengths better.  The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done.  Appropriate size screw was then tightened down.  At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices.  Length was better.  Appropriate size screw was then inserted.  Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted.  At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction.  We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed.  Proper size and fit was noted.  Excellent bony approximation was noted.  At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun.,The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples.  The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine.  Sterile dressing was then applied.  No complication was encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.surgery, displaced, femur fracture, subtrochanteric, hip, synthes, intramedullary rod, subtrochanteric femur, trochanteric fixation, helical blade, tourniquet, intramedullary, trochanteric, fixation, helical, blade, guidewire, fracture,"
2, Discharge Summary - 17 ,"FINAL DIAGNOSIS/REASON FOR ADMISSION:,1.  Acute right lobar pneumonia.,2.  Hypoxemia and hypotension secondary to acute right lobar pneumonia.,3.  Electrolyte abnormality with hyponatremia and hypokalemia - corrected.,4.  Elevated liver function tests, etiology undetermined.,5.  The patient has a history of moderate-to-severe dementia, Alzheimer's type.,6.  Anemia secondary to current illness and possible iron deficiency.,7.  Darkened mole on the scalp, status post skin biopsy, pending pathology report.,OPERATION AND PROCEDURE: , The patient underwent a scalp skin biopsy with pathology specimen obtained on 6/11/2009.  Dr. X performed the procedure, thoracentesis on 6/12/2009 both diagnostic and therapeutic.  Dr. Y's results pending.,DISPOSITION: , The patient discharged to long-term acute facility under the care of Dr. Z.,CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: , Clinically improved, however, requiring acute care.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Include those on admission combined with IV Flagyl 500 mg every 8 hours and Levaquin 500 mg daily.,HOSPITAL SUMMARY: , This is one of several admissions for this 68-year-old female who over the initial 48 hours preceding admission had a complaint of low-grade fever, confusion, dizziness, and a nonproductive cough.  Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.,LABORATORY TESTS: , Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at 5 days.  Sputum culture was negative.  Urine culture was negative and thoracentesis culture negative at 24 hours.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells with the hemoglobin drop to 9 for cardiovascular support, as no evidence of GI bleeding was obtained.  Her most recent blood work on 6/14/2009 revealed a white count of 7000 and hemoglobin of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 36.8.  Her PT and PTT were normal.  Occult blood studies were negative for occult blood.  Hepatitis B antigen was negative.  Hepatitis A antibody IgM was negative.  Hepatitis B core IgM negative, and hepatitis C core antibody was negative.  At the time of discharge on 6/14/2009, sodium was 135, potassium was 3.7, calcium was 8.0, her ALT was 109, AST was 70, direct bilirubin was 0.2, LDH was 219, serum iron was 7, total iron unbound 183, and ferritin level was 267.,At the time of discharge, the patient had improved.  She complained of some back discomfort and lumbosacral back x-ray did reveal some evidence of mild degenerative disk disease with no obvious compression fracture acute noted and she will be followed by Dr. Z.discharge summary, pneumonia, hypoxemia, hypotension, electrolyte abnormality, anemia, scalp skin biopsy, liver function tests, lobar pneumonia, infectious disease, skin biopsy, white count, cultures"
4, Ophthalmology - Letter - 3 ,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear XYZ:,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Mrs. ABC who you referred to me for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.  I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.  If I can provide any additional information or be of further service, do let me know.,Sincerely,,ophthalmology, intraocular pressures, narrow angles, visual fields, angles, intraocular, pressures, anterior, chambers, gonioscopy, glaucoma, narrow, visual, eye, "

4, Phalanx Amputation ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY:,  This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity.  The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.podiatry, osteomyelitis, phalanx, phalanx amputation, proximal margin, plantar flap, distal phalanx, proximal phalanx, proximal, hallux, amputation, foot, plantarly, distal"

4, Psychiatric Consult - 1 ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 53-year-old widowed woman, she lives at ABC Hotel.  She presented with a complaint of chest pain, evaluations revealed severe aortic stenosis.  She has been refusing cardiac catheter and she may well need aortic valve replacement.  She states that she does not want heart surgery or valve replacement.  She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.,The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She is a high-school graduate from ABCD High School.  She did have an abusive childhood.  She is married four times.  She notes she developed depression when a number of her children died.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL: , This is an obese woman in bed.  She is somewhat restless and moving during the interview.,VITAL SIGNS,:  Temperature of 97.3, pulse 70, respirations 18, blood pressure 113/68, and oxygen saturation 94% on 3 L of oxygen.,PSYCHIATRY:  ,Speech is normal, rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary consistent with her educational level.  There is no overt thought disorder.  She does not appear psychotic.  She is not suicidal on formal testing.  She gives the date as Sunday, 05/19/2007 when it is the 20th and 207 when it is 2007.  She is oriented to place.  She can memorize four times, repeats two at five minutes, gets the other two with category hints, this places short-term memory in normal limits.  She had difficulty with serial three subtractions, counting on her fingers and had difficulty naming the months in reverse order stating, ""December, November, September, October, June, July, August, September,"" but recognizes this was not right and then said, ""March, April, May.""  She is able to name objects appropriately.,LABORATORY DATA: , Chest x-ray showing no acute changes.  Carotid duplex shows no stenosis.  Electrolytes and liver function tests are normal.  TSH normal.  Hematocrit 31%.  Triglycerides 152.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Bipolar disorder, apparently stable on medications.,2.  Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.,3.  Aortic stenosis.,4.  Sleep apnea.,5.  Obesity.,6.  Anemia.,7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  It is my impression at present that the patient retains ability to make decisions on her own behalf.  Given this lady's underlying mental problems, I would recommend that her treating physicians discuss her circumstances with physicians who round on her at the ABC Hotel.  While she may well need surgery and cardiac catheter, she may be more willing to accept this in the context of some continued encouragement from care providers who usually provide care for her.  She clearly at this time wants to leave this hospital; she normally gets her care through XYZ Health.  Again, in summary, I would consider her to retain the ability to make decisions on her own behalf.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.psychiatry / psychology, organic brain syndrom, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, mental, abuse, "

4, Craniotomy - Temporal ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Brain tumor left temporal lobe.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Brain tumor left temporal lobe - glioblastoma multiforme.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Left temporal craniotomy.,2.  Removal of brain tumor.,OPERATING MICROSCOPE: , Stealth.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side.  The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.  Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull.  A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.  The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion.  Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle.  We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this.  We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.  Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance.  We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.  This was submitted to pathology.  We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.  They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor.  It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.  We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.  We could see it through the ventricle.  After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal.  The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system.  The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used for skin closure.  The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.  There were no complications of the surgery per se.  The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.,COMMENT:  ,Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.neurology, temporal lobe, brain tumor, lorenz titanium plate, burr hole, cortex, corticectomy, craniotome, craniotomy, frozen section, glioblastoma multiforme, temporal craniotomy, temporoparietal, ventricle, white matter, tumor, temporal, brain,"
4, Agitation - ER Visit ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by family.  Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been poisoned at her care facility.  The daughter who accompanied the patient states that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right now.  The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual vomiting.  She had just finished eating dinner.  No one else in the facility has been ill.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for previous abdominal surgeries.  She has a pacemaker.  She has a history of recent collarbone fracture.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Very difficult to get from the patient herself.  She seems to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly intent on letting me know what is bothering her.  She initially stated that everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints.  Denies chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain.  Denies any extremity symptoms or complaints.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  She is accompanied here with daughter who brought her over here.  They were visiting the patient when this episode occurred.,MEDICATIONS:  Please see list.,ALLERGIES:  NONE.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile, actually has a very normal vital signs including normal pulse oximetry at 99% on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the gurney.  She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the questions I asked her.  She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the daughter states has been there for ""many years"".  HEENT:  Eye exam is unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Actually clear with good breath sounds.  There are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi.  Good air movement.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  I do not elicit any tenderness.  There is no abdominal distention.  Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.  SKIN:  Skin is without rash or petechiae.  There is no cyanosis.  EXTREMITIES:  No evidence of any trauma to the extremities.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I had a long discussion with the family and they would like the patient receive something for agitation, so she was given 0.5 mg of Ativan intramuscularly.  After about half an hour, I came back to talk to the patient and the family, the patient states that she feels better.  Family states she seems more calm.  They do not want to pursue any further workup at this time.,IMPRESSION:  ACUTE EPISODE OF AGITATION.,PLAN:  At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.  The patient herself has good vital signs.  She does not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition.psychiatry / psychology, acute episode of agitation, agitation, "
1, Microlaryngoscopy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Airway obstruction secondary to laryngeal subglottic stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Airway obstruction secondary to laryngeal subglottic stenosis and tracheal stenosis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Suspension microlaryngoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy, dilation of tracheal stenosis.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 56-year-old white female with a history of relapsing polychondritis, which resulted in saddle nose deformity in glottic and subglottic stenosis for which she has undergone number of procedures in the past to the upper airway.  She currently is trach dependent for her airway because of glottic and subglottic stenosis, but she is having no significant problems breathing and talking around her trach tube and came for further evaluation.  Endoscopic reevaluation of her tube and nature of the proposed procedure done.  Risk and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of with speech or swallowing, failure to improve her airway, and loss of voice.  Cardiorespiratory anesthetic results were discussed in length.  The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's #5 metal tracheostomy tube was removed and a #5 laser-safe endotracheal tube was inserted.  The patient was then prepared for endoscopy.  The Kantor laryngoscope was then inserted.  Oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity showed good dentition with good tongue, buccal cavity, and mucosa without lesions.  Larynx was then ***** short epiglottis.  Larynx was suspended with significant scarring beginning in the supraglottic area with loss of laryngeal contour beginning in the supraglottis with extensive scar tissue at the level of the false cord obliteration of ventricles and true cords.  This appeared to be stable, and airway was patent at the supraglottic and glottic level with some narrowing at the subglottic level with mild-to-moderate subglottic stenosis, otherwise this appeared to be stable.  However, distally, the level of the trach site examined with the microscope and 0 and 30-degree telescopes.  The patient noted to have marked narrowing with dense scarring posterolaterally on the left securing good visualization of the trach tube.  The laryngoscope was removed, and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was then passed.  The LP contact tip laser was utilized to vaporize the scar tissue and release the scar banding following which the scope was passed and further dilation carried out.  Mid and distal trachea were widely patent.  Trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent without obvious disease.  The patient did not appear to have any relapsing polychondritis with progressive scar tissue at the level of the trach site and the posterior trachea wall was significant.

2, Gen Med SOAP - 8 ,"SUBJECTIVE: , I am following the patient today for multiple issues.  He once again developed gross hematuria, which was unprovoked.  His Coumadin has been held.  The patient has known BPH and is on Flomax.  He is being treated with Coumadin because of atrial fibrillation and stroke.  This is the second time he has had significant gross hematuria this month.  He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.  No fractures noted however.  He felt that the pain is pretty severe and particularly worse in the morning.  His sinuses are bothering him.  He wonders about getting some nasal saline spray.  We talked about Coumadin, stroke risk, etc. in the setting of atrial fibrillation.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  He is not in any apparent distress.  He is comfortable in a seated position.  I did not examine him further today.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  Hematuria.  Coumadin needs to be stopped, so we will evaluate what is going on, which is probably just some BPH.  We will also obtain a repeat UA as he did describe to me some dysuria.  However, I do not think this would account for the gross hematuria.  He will be started on an aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.,2.  For the pain we will try him on Lortab.  He will get a Lortab everyday in the morning 5/500 prior to getting out of bed, and then he will have the option of having a few more throughout the day if he requires it.,3.  We will see about getting him set up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy as well for his back pain.,4.  For his sinuses, we will arrange for him to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for p.r.n. use.soap / chart / progress notes, multiple issues, atrial fibrillation, gross hematuria, multiple, bph, fibrillation, hematuria,"
1, Otitis Media - Discharge Summary ,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1.  Fever.,2.  Otitis media.,3.  Possible sepsis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral otitis media.,2.  Fever.,PLAN:  ,Recommended discharge.  No restrictions in diet or activity.  He was continued Omnicef 125 mg/5 mL one teaspoon p.o. once daily and instructed to follow up with Dr. X, his primary doctor, on the following Tuesday.  Parents were instructed also to call if new symptoms occurred or he had return if difficulties with breathing or increased lethargy.ent - otolaryngology, sepsis, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, oxygen saturations, otitis media, otitis, breathing, lungs, oropharynx, fever"

Epidermal autograft on Integra to the back (3520 cm2).,2.  Application of allograft to areas of the lost Integra, not grafted on the back (970 cm2).,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Approximately 50 cc.,BLOOD PRODUCTS RECEIVED:,  One unit of packed red blood cells.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 26-year-old male, who sustained a 60% total body surface area flame burn involving the head, face, neck, chest, abdomen, back, bilateral upper extremities, hands, and bilateral lower extremities.  He has previously undergone total burn excision with placement of Integra and an initial round of epidermal autografting to the bilateral upper extremities and hands.  His donor sites have healed particularly over his buttocks and he returns for a second round of epidermal autografting over the Integra on his back utilizing the buttock donor sites, the extent they will provide coverage.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,1.  Variable take of Integra, particularly centrally and inferiorly on the back.  A fair amount of lost Integra over the upper back and shoulders.,2.  No evidence of infection.,3.  Healthy viable wound beds prior to grafting.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine.  General endotracheal anesthesia was uneventfully induced and an appropriate time out was performed.  He was then repositioned prone and perioperative IV antibiotics were administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  All staples were removed from the Integra and the adherent areas of Silastic were removed.  The entire wound bed was further prepped with scrub brushes and more Betadine followed by a sulfamylon solution.  Hemostasis of the wound bed was ensured using epinephrine-soaked Telfa pads.  Following dermal tumescence of the buttocks, epidermal autografts were harvested 8 one-thousandths of an inch using the air Zimmer dermatome.  These grafts were passed to the back table where they were meshed 3:1.  The donor sites were hemostased using epinephrine-soaked Telfa and lap pads.  Once all the  grafts were meshed, we brought them back up onto the field, positioned them over the wounds beginning inferiorly and moving cephalad where we had best areas of Integra engraftment.  We were happy with the lie of the grafts and they were stapled into place.  The grafts were then overlaid with Conformant 2, which was also stapled into place.  Utilizing all of his buttocks skin, we did not have enough to cover his entire back, so we elected to apply allograft to the cephalad and a few areas on his flanks where we had had poor Integra engraftment.  Allograft was thawed and meshed 1:1.  It was then brought up onto the field, trimmed to fit and stapled into place over the wound.  Once the entirety of the posterior wounds on his back were covered out with epidermal autograft or allograft sulfamylon soaked dressings were applied.  Donor sites on his buttocks were dressed in Acticoat and secured with staples.  He was then repositioned supine and extubated in the operating room having tolerated the procedure without any apparent complications.  He was transported to PACU in stable condition.dermatology, flame burns, body surface area, epidermal autograft, autograft, integra, integra engraftment, wound, grafts, epidermal, allograft, "
1, Prostatectomy - Nerve Sparing ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prostate cancer.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 450 mL.,REPLACEMENT:,  250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: , This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate.  Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.urology, prostate cancer, foley catheter, gleason, psa, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder neck, core biopsy, figure-of-eight, lymph node dissection, nerve-sparing, prostatectomy, rectus fascia, retropubic, bladder neck dissection, dorsal vein complex, nerve sparing, perirectal fat, seminal vesicles, sutures, bladder, urethra, posteriorly, seminal, vesicles, fascia, neck, dissection,"
4, Rotator Cuff Tear ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.orthopedic, upper extremity, radiculopathy, rotator cuff repair, cervical spinal stenosis, rotator cuff tear, physical examination, cuff, impingement, stenosis, extremity, surgery, tear, shoulder, rotator, cervical,"
3, Melena - ICU Followup ,"HISTORY:,  Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.  Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.

EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.general medicine, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"
1, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - 4 ,"PROCEDURE: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.surgery, olympus gif-160, pcf-160, endoscopy, crohn's disease, aphthous ulcers, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscope, esophagus, duodenum, mucosal, stomach, biopsies, colonoscopy"

The patient presented later that evening after having increasing abdominal pain, fever and chills at home with a temperature up to 101.2.  The patient denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She does complain of some frequent urination.  Her vaginal bleeding is minimal.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap.  There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall.  The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.  The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey.  All instruments were removed.  The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief.  Steri-Strips were then placed across the incision.  The uterine manipulator was then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.,She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital and started on IV antibiotics.surgery, uterine perforation, vascular, bowel, diagnostic laparoscopy, vulsellum tenaculum, uterine manipulator, excellent hemostasis, rigid sigmoidoscopy, laparoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, postoperatively, trocar, "
2, Discharge Summary - ATV Accident ,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.  Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008).,5.  CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008).,DISPOSITION:  ,Home with parents.,INVASIVE LINES: , None.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity.  He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics.  Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand.discharge summary, humerus fracture, trauma, irrigation and debridement, atv accident, upper extremity, humerus, fracture, orthopedic,"
1, Urgent Cardiac Cath ,"PROCEDURE: , Urgent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiogram.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought urgently to the cardiac cath lab from the emergency room with the patient being intubated with an abnormal EKG and a cardiac arrest.  The right groin was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Under 2% lidocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was entered.  A 6-French sheath was placed.  The patient was already on anticoagulation.  Selective coronary angiograms were then performed using a left and a 3DRC catheter.  The catheters were reviewed.  The catheters were then removed and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There was some hematoma at the cath site.,RESULTS,1.  The left main was free of disease.,2.  The left anterior descending and its branches were free of disease.,3.  The circumflex was free of disease.,4.  The right coronary artery was free of disease.

4, Consult - Alzheimer disease  ,"The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home.  She balances her own checkbook.  She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past.  She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving.  She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home.  She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren.  She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression.  There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home.  She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister.  She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren.  She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations.  She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it.  When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot.  She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication.  She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly.  She denies visual or migraine symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia.  She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus.  Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness.  She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago.  The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed.  This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations.  The mesothelioma is in her abdomen.  She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma.  She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma.  Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable.  She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position.  These have all occurred over the past five years.  She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation.  This diagnosis was given in March 2006.,MEDICATIONS:,  Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.,ALLERGIES:, NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for her being without a companion at this point.  She was born in Munich, Germany.  She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time.  She is divorced.  She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM.  She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma.  She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.  She is bilingual speaking, German and English.  She has known English from before her teens.

She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz.  He has grandchildren.  She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer.  Her mother died in her 80s of ""old age,"" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time.  Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient.  No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg.  She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress.  She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date.  She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in.  She lost three points for recall.  Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember.  Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30.  There were no naming problems or problems with repetition.  There were also no signs of dysarthria.  Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular movements were intact.  Her visual fields were full to confrontation.  Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal.  There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation.  Tongue was midline.  Her palate was symmetric.  Her face was symmetric as well.  Strength was approximately 5/5.  She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain.  Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace.  Her plantar reflexes were mute.  Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration.  There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia.  Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.,SUMMARY:,  Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.  We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured.  We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.  She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept.  The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV.  It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.  She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept.  She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day.  We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.,neurology, neurology consultation, dementing illness, alzheimer disease, dementia, alzheimer, mesothelioma,"

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.,After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room.surgery, herniation, andrews frame, csf leakage, depo-medrol, l4-5, proxi-strips, diskectomy, endotracheal anesthesia, lumbosacral fascia, modified knee-chest position, radiculopathy, supine position, nerve root, duraprep, "

History of congenital genitourinary abnormalities with multiple surgeries before the 5th grade.,3.  History of urinary tract infections of pyelonephritis.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Chest x-ray July 24, 2007, that was normal.  Transesophageal echocardiogram July 27, 2007, that was normal.  No evidence of vegetations.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis July 27, 2007, that revealed multiple small cysts in the liver, the largest measuring 9 mm.  There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan was normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.  Diet is as tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.  Additional followup is also with Dr. XYZ, her primary care physician.  Please note that 40 minutes was spent in the discharge.discharge summary, abdomen and pelvis, gram negative rod, congenital genitourinary, genitourinary abnormalities, transesophageal echocardiogram, infectious diseases, leptospirosis serologies, gram negative, ct scan, identification, infections, levofloxacin, additional, discharge"

The ingrown part of the toenail was freed from its bed and removed, then a flap of skin had been made in the area of the matrix supplying the particular part of the toenail.  The matrix was excised down to the bone and then the skin flap was placed over it.  Hemostasis had been achieved with a cautery.  A tubular dressing was performed to provide a bulky dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was negligible.

Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.orthopedic, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "

Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.urology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl sutures, pelvis, renal, ureteropelvic, sutures, "

3, Gen Med Consult - 19 ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 2-year-old female who comes in for just rechecking her weight, her breathing status, and her diet.  The patient is in foster care, has a long history of the prematurity, born at 22 weeks.  She has chronic lung disease, is on ventilator, but doing sprints, has been doing very well, is up to 4-1/2 hours sprints twice daily and may go up 15 minutes every three days or so; which she has been tolerating fairly well as long as they kind of get her distracted towards the end, otherwise, she does get sort of tachypneic.  She is on 2-1/2 liters of oxygen and does require that.  Her diet has been fluctuating.  They have been trying to figure out what works best with her.  She has been on some Pediasure for the increased calories but that really makes her distended in the abdomen and constipates her.  They have been doing more pureed foods and that seems to loosen her up, so they have been doing more Isomil 24 cal and baby foods and not so much Pediasure.  She was hospitalized a couple of weeks back for the distension she had in the abdomen.  Dr. XYZ has been working with her G-tube, increasing her Mic-key button size, but also doing some silver nitrate applications, and he is going to evaluate her again next week, but they are happy with the way her G-tube site is looking.  She also has been seen Dr. Eisenbaum, just got of new pair of glasses this week and sees him in another couple of weeks for reevaluation.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Flagyl, vitamins, Zyrtec, albuterol, and some Colace.,ALLERGIES TO MEDICINES: , None.,FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY:,  As mentioned, she is in foster care.  Foster mom is actually going to be out of town for a week the 19th through the 23rd, so she will probably be hospitalized in respite care because there are no other foster care situations that can handle the patient.  Biological Mom and Grandma do visit on Thursdays for about an hour.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient has been eating fairly well, sleeping well, doing well with her sprints.  A little difficulty with her stools hard versus soft as mentioned with the diet situation up in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  She is 28 pounds 8 ounces today, 33-1/2 inches tall.  She is on 2-1/2 liters, but she is not the vent currently, she is doing her sprints, and her respiratory rate is around 40.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear.  TMs are clear.  Nares are patent.  Oropharynx is clear.  Trach site is clear of any signs of infection.,Chest:  Coarse.  She has got little bit of wheezing going on, but she is moving air fairly well.,Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds and soft.  The G-tube site looks fairly clean today and healthy.  No signs of infection.  Her tone is good.  Capillary refill is less than three seconds.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-year-old with chronic lung disease, doing the sprints, some bowel difficulties, also just weight gain issues because of the high-energy expenditure with the sprints that she is doing.,PLAN:,  At this point is to continue with the Isomil and pureed baby foods, a little bit of Pediasure.  They are going to see Dr. XYZ towards the end of this month and follow up with Dr. Eisenbaum.  I would like to see her in approximately six weeks again, but we do need to keep a close check on her weight and call if there are problems beforehand.  She is just doing wonderful progression on her development.  Each time I see her, I am very impressed, that relayed to foster mom.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with the patient, most of it counseling.general medicine, chronic lung disease, signs of infection, breathing status, foster mom, foster care, pediasure"

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.  Lid speculum was removed.  TobraDex ointment, light patch and a Soft Shield were applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room, awake and comfortable.  We will follow up in the morning for postoperative check.  He will not be given Diamox due to his sulfa allergy.

1, Intraocular Lens Implant ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant with penetrating keratoplasty.,2.  A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.

The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.surgery, vitrectomy, endolaser, keratoplasty, intraocular lens implant, preretinal hemorrhage, scleral flaps, intraocular, keratoprosthesis, chamber, implant, scleral, vitreoretinal, lens, sutures, eye, "
2, Leg Pain & Bone Pain ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Leg pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 56-year-old female who has pain in her legs at nighttime and when she gets up it comes and goes, radiates from her buttocks to her legs, sometimes it is her ankle.  She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor.  She has had some night sweats occasionally.  She has had a little bit of fever and nausea.  She has noticed her blood sugars have been low.  She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita.  She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120.  Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185.  She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time.  She has been eating more meat recently and has not been on a diet for cholesterol.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Include Lipitor 80 mg q.d. discontinued today, Vioxx 25 mg q.d., Maxzide 37/25 q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg at h.s., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Glucovance 1.25/250 b.i.d. decreased to one a day today, Monopril 20 mg q.d., estradiol one mg q.d., and glucosamine 1000 mg q.d.,ALLERGIES:,  Cipro, sulfa, Bactrim, and Demerol.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight is 248 pounds which is a 12-pound drop from January.

Straight leg lifts are normal.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,1.  Leg pain/bone pain, I am going to check her CMP.  I think this possibly is a side effect from Lipitor.  We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time.  Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects.  We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.,2.  Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic.  Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor.  We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor.  If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month.  I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP.  Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.,3.  Type II diabetes.  We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.  Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms.  I am also going to check a hemoglobin A1c at Mapleridge in Wichita and have a followup here in one month for that diabetes appointment.soap / chart / progress notes, cmp, hypercholesterolemia, leg pain, type ii diabetes, ankle, blood sugars, bone pain, buttocks, pain, radiates from her buttocks, leg pain/bone, leg, sugars, weight,"

The patient had oligohydramnios and also when placed on the monitor had nonreassuring fetal heart rate with late deceleration.  Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Skin edges reapproximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The uterus was evacuated of any remaining clots vaginally.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.

4, Phacoemulsification & Cataract Extraction ,"DIAGNOSIS:,  Nuclear sclerotic and cortical cataract, right eye.,OPERATION:,  Phacoemulsification and extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, right eye.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Cardiac monitor and oxygen at 5 liters per minute were connected by the nursing staff.  Local anesthesia was obtained using 2% lidocaine, 0/75% Marcaine, 0.5 cc Wydase with 6 cc of this solution used in a paribulbar injection, followed by ten minutes of digital massage.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for eye surgery.  With the Zeiss operating microscopy in position, a lid speculum was inserted and a 4-0 black silk bridal suture placed in the superior rectus muscle.  With Westcott scissors, a fornix-based conjunctival flap was made.  The surgical limbus was identified and hemostasis obtained with wet-field cautery.  With a 57-Beaver blade, a corneoscleral groove was made and shelved into clear cornea.  A stab incision was made at 2 o'clock with a 15-degree blade.  With a 3.0 mm keratome, the shelved groove was attended into the anterior chamber.  Viscoelastic was inserted into the anterior chamber and anterior capsulotomy was performed in a continuous-tear technique.  Hydrodissection was performed with Balanced Salt Solution.  Phacoemulsification was performed in a two-headed nuclear fracture technique.  The remaining cortical material was removed with irrigation and aspiration handpiece.  The posterior capsule remained intact and vacuumed with minimal suction.  The posterior chamber intraocular lens was obtained.  It was inspected, irrigated, inserted into the posterior chamber without difficulty.  Inspection revealed the intraocular lens to be in good position with intact capsule and well-approximated wound.  There was no aqueous leak even with digital pressure.  The conjunctiva was pulled back into position with wet-field cautery.  A subconjunctival injection with 20 mg Gatamycine and 0.5 cc Celestone was given.  Tobradex ointment was instilled into the eye, which was patched and shielded appropriately, after removing the lid speculum and bridle suture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition, to be followed in attending physician office the next day.ophthalmology, extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification, nuclear sclerotic, cortical cataract, extraction with intraocular lens, cataract extraction, intraocular lens, intraocular, extracapsular, implantation, conjunctival, cataract, chamberNOTE"

Chondroplasty of the left knee as well.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 80 cc.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: , 19 minutes.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old male with left knee pain for approximately two years secondary to hockey injury where he did have a prior MCL sprain.  He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.surgery, medial meniscoplasty, arthroscopic, chondroplasty, arthroscopy, medial femoral condyle, medial meniscus, knee, meniscal, cartilage, meniscoplasty, meniscus, chondromalacia, condyle, femoral"
3, Sleep Apnea ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Mr. ABC is a 30-year-old man who returns in followup of his still moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  He returns today to review his response to CPAP.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment.,The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night.,The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night.,As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.

1, Orchiectomy & Testis Fixation ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Nonpalpable right undescended testis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis.,PROCEDURES: , Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block.,FLUID RECEIVED:  ,250 mL of crystalloids.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 5 mL.,SPECIMEN:,  The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant.,ABNORMAL FINDINGS:,  Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring.  Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis.  The plan is for evaluation and repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  The patient was placed in supine position and examined.  The left testis well within scrotum.  The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.,The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.urology, diagnostic laparoscopy, caudal block, testis fixation, undescended testis, subcutaneous closure, testis, orchiectomy, laparoscopy, testicular, scrotum"
4, Conversion Disorder ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of Children's Hospital after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder.  I had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptoms and background at that time.  After his discharge, the patient was scheduled to see me for followup services.  This was a 90-minute intake that was completed on 10/10/2007 with the patient's mother.  I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEMS:,  Please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information.  The patient's mother reported that he continues with his conversion episodes.  She noted that they are occurring approximately 6 times a day.  They consist primarily of tremors, arching his back, and, by her report, doing some gang signs during the episode.  She reported that the conversion reactions had decreased after his hospitalization, and he had none for 3 days, but then, they began picking up again.  From information gathered from mother, it would suggest that she frequently does ""status checks,"" where she asks him how he is doing, and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reactions.  In terms of what she does when he has a conversion reaction, she reported that primarily that she tries to keep him safe.  She puts a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty.  She removes any furniture, she wraps his legs together so they do not knock together, she sits with him and she gives him attention and says ""calm down, breathe"" and after it is over, she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe.  She denied that she gives them any more attention.  I strongly encouraged her to stop doing status checks, as this likely is reinforcing the behavior.  I also noted that while he certainly needs to be kept safe, that she does not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior, and that over time we will teach him ways of coping with this independently.  In regards to his mood, she reported that his mood is quite good.  She denied any sadness or irritability.  She denied anhedonia.  She reports that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning.  He is going to bed at about 11, getting up at 8 or 9.  No changes in weight or eating were noted.  No changes in concentration, suicidal ideation, and any suicidal history was denied.  She denied symptoms of anxiety, although she did note that she thought he worried a little about going to school and some financial stress.  Other symptoms of psychopathology were denied.,DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery.  Mother reported that she did receive prenatal care.  The use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  She denied that he had any feeding or sleeping problems in the perinatal period.  She described him as a fussy and active baby, but he was described as a cuddly baby.  She noted that the pediatricians never expressed any concerns regarding his developmental milestones.  SHE REPORTED THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.  Serious injures or toileting problems were denied as were a history of seizures.,FAMILY BACKGROUND: , The patient currently lives with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40.  They have been together since 1994, and he is the only father figure that the patient has even known.  The father was previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11-year-old daughter who visits the patient's home every other weekend.  The patient's father's whereabouts are unknown.  There is no information on his family.  Mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she was about 3 months pregnant with the patient, and the patient has never met him.  As noted, there is no information on the paternal side of the family.  In terms of the mother's side of family, the maternal grandfather died in his 60s due to what mother described as ""hardening of the arteries,"" and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke.  There were 4 maternal aunts, one of them died at age 9 months from pneumonia, one of them died at 19 years old from what was described as a brain tumor, and there are 3 maternal uncles.  In terms of family relationships, it was reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parents, who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother's attention, and she noted this is difficult at times.  She reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together.  Mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home, but there is some marital conflict, and this is may be difficult for The patient, as it is carried on in Spanish, and he does not speak Spanish.  There also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter, as there are some concerns that her mother may be involved in drugs.  The mother reported that she attended high school, did not attend any college.  She denied learning problems.  She denied psychological problems or any drug/alcohol history.  In terms of the biological father, she reported he did not graduate from high school.  She did not know of learning problems, psychological problems.  She denied that he had a drug/alcohol history.  There is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncles as well as in the maternal grandfather.  It should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4-bedroom apartment, where privacy is very difficult.,SOCIAL BACKGROUND:,  She reported that the patient is able to make and keep friends, but he enjoys lifting weights, skateboarding, and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing, he really enjoyed that.  I encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity, as this is good for discharge the stress, to encourage the weightlifting, as well as the skateboarding.  Mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in, which was at it sounds like by her description as some sort of boys' and girls' type of club.  Abuse of drugs or alcohol were denied.  The patient was not described as being sexually active.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: , The patient is currently in the 10th grade.  At present, he is on independent studies, which began after his hospitalization.  The mother reported that the teacher, who had come to school saw one of his episodes, and stated that, they would not want him to be attending school.  I spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it was probably not best for the patient to be on independent studies, that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment.  He has never had an episode at school, and he needs to be back with his peers, back in a regular environment, where he is under normal expectations.  I spoke with her regarding my concerns, regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day, and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation, where he is not getting his work done, and he gets himself in trouble.  Normally, he would be attending at High School.  The mother stated that she would contact them as well as check into possibly a 504-Plan.  She reported that he really does not to go back to High School.  He says, the ""kids are bad;"" however, she denied that he has any history of fighting.  She noted that he is stressed by the school, there have been some peer problems, possibly some bullying.  I noted these need to be addressed with the school, as she had not done so.  She stated that she would speak with a counselor.  She noted, however, that he has a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school.  She noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization.  His grades traditionally are C's.  She denied any Special Education Services.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING: , Denied.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: , Similar to my impression at the hospital, it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder.  It appears that there are multiple stressors in the family, and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction.  I am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment as quickly as possible.  My plan is to meet the patient at the next session to update the information regarding his functioning and to begin to teach him skills for reducing his stress and relaxing.,DSM-IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).,AXIS II:  No diagnosis (V71.09).,AXIS III:  No diagnosis.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, educational problems, and peer problems.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning equals 60.psychiatry / psychology, developmental history, academic background, global assessment of functioning, normal school environment, conversion reactions, conversion disorder, conversion, background, environment, peers, disorder, axis,"

1, Laparoscopic Hysterectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endometrial carcinoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endometrial carcinoma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with laparoscopic staging, including paraaortic lymphadenectomy, bilateral pelvic and obturator lymphadenectomy, and washings.,ANESTHESIA: , General, endotracheal tube.,SPECIMENS: , Pelvic washings for cytology; uterus with attached right tube and ovary; pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection; obturator lymph node dissection.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient was recently found to have a grade II endometrial cancer.  She was counseled to undergo laparoscopic staging.,FINDINGS:,  During the laparoscopy, the uterus was noted to be upper limits of normal size, with a normal-appearing right fallopian tubes and ovaries.  No ascites was present.  On assessment of the upper abdomen, the stomach, diaphragm, liver, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces of the bowel, were all unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought into the operating room with an intravenous line in placed, and anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in a low anterior lithotomy position using Allen stirrups.  The vaginal portion of the procedure included placement of a ZUMI uterine manipulator with a Koh colpotomy ring and a vaginal occluder balloon.,The laparoscopic port sites were anesthetized with intradermal injection of 0.25% Marcaine.  There were five ports placed, including a 3-mm left subcostal port, a 10-mm umbilical port, a 10-mm suprapubic port, and 5-mm right and left lower quadrant ports.  The Veress needle was placed through a small incision at the base of the umbilicus, and a pneumoperitoneum was insufflated without difficulty.  The 3-mm port was then placed in the left subcostal position without difficulty, and a 3-mm scope was placed.  There were no adhesions underlying the previous vertical midline scar.  The 10-mm port was placed in the umbilicus, and the laparoscope was inserted.  Remaining ports were placed under direct laparoscopic guidance.  Washings were obtained from the pelvis, and the abdomen was explored with the laparoscope, with findings as noted.,Attention was then turned to lymphadenectomy.  An incision in the retroperitoneum was made over the right common iliac artery, extending up the aorta to the retroperitoneal duodenum.  The lymph node bundle was elevated from the aorta and the anterior vena cava until the retroperitoneal duodenum had been reached.  Pedicles were sealed and divided with bipolar cutting forceps.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  Boundaries of dissection included the ureters laterally, common ileac arteries at uterine crossover inferiorly, and the retroperitoneal duodenum superiorly with careful preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery.  Right and left pelvic retroperitoneal spaces were then opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament with the bipolar cutting forceps.  The retroperitoneal space was then opened and the lymph nodes were dissected, with boundaries of dissection being the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, psoas muscle laterally, inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior boundary was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  The left common iliac lymph node was elevated and removed using the same technique.,Attention was then turned to the laparoscopic hysterectomy.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was divided using the bipolar cutting forceps.  The mesovarium was skeletonized.  A bladder flap was mobilized by dividing the round ligaments using the bipolar cutting forceps, and the peritoneum on the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.  Once the Koh colpotomy ring was skeletonized and in position, the uterine arteries were sealed using the bipolar forceps at the level of the colpotomy ring.  The vagina was transected using a monopolar hook (or bipolar spatula), resulting in separation of the uterus and attached tubes and ovaries.  The uterus, tubes, and ovaries were then delivered through the vagina, and the pneumo-occluder balloon was reinserted to maintain pneumoperitoneum.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches of 0-Vicryl using the Endo-Stitch device.  The abdomen was irrigated, and excellent hemostasis was noted.,The insufflation pressure was reduced, and no evidence of bleeding was seen.  The suprapubic port was then removed, and the fascia was closed with a Carter-Thomason device and 0-Vicryl suture.  The remaining ports were removed under direct laparoscopic guidance, and the pneumoperitoneum was released.  The umbilical port was removed using laparoscopic guidance.  The umbilical fascia was closed with an interrupted figure-of-eight stitch using 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with interrupted subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.

2, Oligoarticular Arthritis - 1 ,"HISTORY:,  A is here for a follow up appointment at our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic as well as the CCS Clinic.  A is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee.  He had a joint injection back in 03/2007 and since then he has been doing relatively well.  He is taking Indocin only as needed even though he said he has pain regularly, and he said that his knee has not changed since the beginning, but he said he only takes the medicine when he has pain, which is not every day, but almost every day.  He denies any swelling more than what it was before, and he denies any other joints are affected at this moment.  Denies any fevers or any rashes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination, his temperature is 98.6, weight is 104.6 kg; which is 4.4 kg less than before, 108/70 is his blood pressure, weight is 91.0 kg, and his pulse is 80.  He is alert, active, and oriented in no distress.  He has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limit.  He has no cataracts and symmetric pupils to light and accommodation.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rhythm with no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender with no :  visceromegaly.  Musculoskeletal examination showed good range of motion of all his upper extremities with no swelling or tenderness.  Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.,In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.  Discussed this with A and his aunt and they had no further questions.consult - history and phy., rheumatology, rheumatology clinic, lower extremities, oligoarticular arthritis, arthritis, oligoarticular, knee, swelling,"

Insertion of intervertebral device, C7-T1.,5.  Use of operating microscope.,ANESTHESIOLOGY: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,A 30 mL.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where he was orally intubated by The Anesthesiology Service.  He was placed in the supine position on an OR table.  His arms were carefully taped down.  He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A 4-cm incision was made obliquely over the left side of his neck.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the platysma.  The platysma was incised using electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was done to create a plane between the strap muscles and the sternoclavicular mastoid muscle.  This allowed us to get right down on to the anterior cervical spine.  Blunt dissection was done to sweep off the longus colli.  We isolated the C7-T1 interspace.  An x-ray was taken to verify; we were indeed at the C7-T1 interspace.,Shadow-Line retractor was placed as well as Caspar pins.  This provided very, very good access to the C7-T1 disk.,At this point, the operating microscope was brought into the decompression.,A thorough and aggressive C7-T1 discectomy was done using a succession of curettes, pituitary rongeur, 4-mm cutting bur and a #2 Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the discectomy, the cartilaginous endplates were carefully removed using 4-mm cutting burr.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was carefully resected using #2 Kerrison rongeur.  Left-sided C8 foraminotomy was accomplished using nerve hook and a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the decompression, there was no further compression on the left C8 nerve root.,A Synthes cortical cancellous ____________ bone was placed in the interspace.  Sofamor Danek Atlantis plate was then placed over the interspace and four screws were placed, two in the body of C7 and two in the body of T1.  An x-ray was taken.  It showed good placement of the plate and screws.,A deep drain was placed.  The platysma layer was closed in running fashion using #1 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed in an interrupted fashion using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed in a running fashion using 4-0 Monocryl.  Steri-Strips and dressings were applied.

1, Revision Rhinoplasty. ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Nasal deformity, status post rhinoplasty.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE:,  Revision rhinoplasty (CPT 30450).  Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.,The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest.surgery, nasal deformity, rhinoplasty, conchal cartilage harvest, conchal bulb, conchal, submucoperichondrial, gull-wing incision, gore-tex, gull wing incision, lower lateral cartilages, revision rhinoplasty, nasal dorsum, cartilage harvest, conchal cartilage, cartilage, nasal, deformity, hemostasis, columella, harvest, cartilages"

He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.

Laparoscopic appendectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal and injectable 1% lidocaine and 0.25% Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Appendix.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 37-year-old Caucasian female presented to ABCD General Hospital with progressively worsening suprapubic and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which progressed throughout its course starting approximately 12 hours prior to presentation.  She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

She has had undergone multiple previous endoscopic procedures in the past; last procedure was in January 2007.  She returns with some increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  Endoscopic reevaluation is offered to her.  The patient has been considering laryngotracheal reconstruction; however, due to a recent death in the family, she has postponed this, but she has been having increasing symptoms.  An endoscopic treatment was offered to her.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications involving bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, or swallowing, hoarseness changing permanently, recurrence of stenosis despite a surgical intervention, airway obstruction necessitating a tracheostomy now or in the future, cardiorespiratory, and anesthetic risks were all discussed in length.  The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed on table in supine position.  Following adequate general anesthesia, the patient was prepared for endoscopy.  The top sliding laryngoscope was then inserted in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx examined. In the oral cavity, she had good dentition.  Tongue and buccal cavity mucosa were without ulcers, masses, or lesions.  The oropharynx was clear.  The larynx was then manually suspended.  Epiglottis area, epiglottic folds, false cords, true vocal folds with some mild edema, but otherwise, without ulcers, masses, or lesions, and the supraglottic and glottic airway were widely patent.  The larynx was manually suspended and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the vocal folds.  At the base of the subglottis, there was a narrowing and in the upper trachea, restenosis had occurred.  Moderate amount of mucoid secretions, these were suctioned, following which the area of stenosis was dilated.  Remainder of the bronchi was then examined.  The mid and distal trachea were widely patent.  Pale pink mucosa takeoff from mainstem bronchi were widely patent without ulcers, lesions, or evidence of scarring.  The scope was pulled back and removed and following this, a 6 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was passed through the larynx and further dilatation carried out.  Once this had been completed, dramatic improvement in the subglottic upper tracheal airway accomplished.

1, Low -Segment C-Section ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Pregnancy at 42 weeks, nonreassuring fetal testing, and failed induction.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pregnancy at 42 weeks, nonreassuring fetal testing, and failed induction.,PROCEDURE: , Primary low segment cesarean section.  The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia.  Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way.  The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles.  These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically.  The uterus was in mid position.  The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad.  A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly.  Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid.  A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position.  The infant breathed and cried spontaneously.  The nares and pharynx were suctioned.  The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team.  Cord blood samples were obtained.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure.  The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first.  Hemostasis was completed with an additional figure-of-eight suture of 0 Vicryl.  The cornual sac and gutters were irrigated.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  The adnexa were inspected and were normal.  The abdomen was then closed in layers.  Fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with running 3-0 plain Catgut, and skin with 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture and Steri-Strips.  Blood loss was estimated at 700 mL.  All counts were correct.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in excellent condition.surgery, nonreassuring fetal testing, anterior rectus fascia, pennington clamps, fetal testing, low segment, induction, suture,"
4, Mass Excision - Foot ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Excision of soft tissue mass, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 51-year-old female with complaints of soft tissue mass over the dorsum of the right foot.  The patient has had previous injections to the site which have caused the mass to decrease in size, however, the mass continues to be present and is irritated and painful with shoes.  The patient has requested surgical intervention at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted from the preoperative holding area to the operating room.  The patient was then placed on the operating room table in the supine position and a towel was placed around the patient's abdomen and secured her to the table.  Using copious amounts of Webril, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied to her right ankle.  Using a Skin Skribe, the area of the soft tissue mass was outlined over the dorsum of her foot.  After adequate amount of anesthesia was provided by the Department of Anesthesia, a local ankle block was given using 10 cc of 4.5 mL of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1.0 mL of Solu-Medrol and the foot was scrubbed and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  Following this, the ankle was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot and the ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought back down to the table using bandage scissors.  The stockinette was reflected and the right foot was exposed.  Using a fresh #10 blade, a curvilinear incision was performed over the dorsum of the right foot.  Then using a #15 blade, the incision was deepened with care taken to identify and avoid or cauterize any bleeders which were noted.  Following this, the incision was deepened using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection and the muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle was identified.  Further dissection was then performed in the medial direction in the area of the soft tissue mass.  The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve was identified and gently retracted laterally.  Large amounts of adipose tissue were noted medial to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.  Using careful dissection, adipose tissue in this area was removed and saved for pathology.  Following removal of adipose tissue in this area and identification of no more adipose tissue, attention was directed lateral to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, which was also noted to have large amounts of adipose tissue in this area as well.  Using careful dissection, from the lateral border of the foot as much adipose tissue as possible was removed from this area as well and saved for pathology.  There was noted to be no other fluid-filled masses or lesions identifiable in this area then between the slits of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, careful dissection was performed to examine the underside of the belly of the muscle as well as structures beneath and no abnormal structures were identified here as well.  Following this, feeling adequately that no other mass remained in the area, the incision was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline.  The wound was then reinspected and all remaining tissues appeared healthy including the subcutaneous tissue.  The tendon and muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the nerves of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve and also the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve which were identified medially, all appeared intact.  No deficits were noted.  No abnormal appearing tissue was present within the surgical site.  Following this, the skin edges were reapproximated using #4-0 Vicryl deep closure of the subcutaneous layer was performed.  Then, using #4-0 nylon and simple interrupted suture, the skin was reapproximated and closed with care taken to ensure eversion of the skin edges and good approximation of the borders.  The patient was also given 7 cc of 1% lidocaine plain throughout the procedure to augment local anesthesia.  Following this, the wound was dressed using Xeroform gauze and 4x4s and was dressed using two ABD pads, dorsal and plantar for compression and using Kling, Kerlix and Coban.  The patient then had the ankle tourniquet deflated with a total tourniquet time of 55 minutes at 250 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to digits one through five of the right foot.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was noted to have vascular status intact.  The patient was then escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where she was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then given postoperative instructions to include ice and elevation to her right foot.  The patient was cleared for ambulation as tolerated, but was instructed that with increased ambulation will come increased swelling and pain.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X in his office on Tuesday, 08/26/03 for further follow up.  The patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen #25 taken one tablet q.4h. p.r.n., moderate to severe pain and also prescription for Keflex #20 500 mg tablets to be taken b.i.d. x10 days.  The patient was given a number for the Emergency Room and instructed to return if any sign or symptom of infection should present and the patient was educated as to the nature of these.

3, Mitral Valve Repair & Annuloplasty ,"OPERATIONS,1.  Mitral valve repair using a quadrangular resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet.,2.  Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.

At the time of initial consultation, the patient was also found to have bilateral carpal tunnel and for which we are addressing the left side now.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him for most of the risk would be that of infection because of the patient's diabetes and a previous history of infection in the form of pneumonia.  There is also the possibility of bleeding as well as the possibility of injury to the median nerve on dissection.  He understood this risk and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction of anesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask, he remained supine on the operating table.  The left upper extremity was then prepped with Betadine soap and antiseptic solution.  After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made following inflation of blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg.  Clamp time approximately 30 minutes.  An incision was then made right in the mid palm area between the thenar and hypothenar eminence.  Meticulous hemostasis of any bleeders were done.  The fat was identified.  The palmar aponeurosis was identified and cut and this was traced down to the wrist.  There was severe compression of the median nerve.  Additional removal of the aponeurosis was performed to allow for further decompression.  After this was all completed, the area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin solution and closed as a single layer using Prolene 4-0 as interrupted vertical mattress stitches.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery.surgery, compression, wrist, carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve, tunnel, carpal, "

He undergoes dialysis through the left forearm bridge fistula and has small pseudoaneurysms at the needle puncture sites level.  There is narrowing at the distal anastomosis due to intimal hypoplasia and the vein beyond it was of good quality.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite, placed in supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Left arm was prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was created just below the antecubital crease just deeper to the subcutaneous tissue.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections segment of the fistula was isolated ________ vessel loop.  Transverse graftotomy was created.  A #4 Fogarty catheter passed proximally and distally restoring inflow and meager inflow.  A fistulogram was performed and the above findings were noted.  In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.  Longitudinal venotomy created along the anteromedial wall.  A 7 mm graft was brought on to the field and this was cut to shape and size.  This was sewed to the graft in an end-to-side fashion with U-clips anchoring the graft at the heel and toe with interrupted #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The vein flushed with heparinized saline and graft was controlled with vascular clamp.  The end of the insertion graft was cut to shape in length and sutured to the graft in an end-to-end fashion with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The graftotomy was then closed with interrupted #6-0 Prolene suture.  Flow through the fistula was permitted, a good flow passed.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needles, instrument counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable sutures.

Painful enlarged navicula, right foot.,2.  Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot.,2.  Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise.orthopedic, navicula, metatarsal, osteochondroma, tarsectomy, metatarsectomy, painful enlarged navicula, navicular bone, foot, bony, capsule, periosteum, navicular, incision, bone"

Under effects of general endotracheal anesthesia, markings were made preoperatively for the mastopexy.  An eccentric circle was drawn around the nipple and a wedge drawn from the inferior border of the areola to the inframammary fold.  A stab incision was made bilaterally and tumescent infiltration of anesthesia, lactated ringers with 1 cc of epinephrine to 1000 cc of lactated ringers was infused with a tumescent blunt needle.  200 cc was infiltrated on each side.  This was followed by power-assisted liposuction and manual liposuction with removal of 350 cc of supernatant fat from both sides utilizing a radial tunneling technique with a 4-mm cannula.  This was followed by the epithelialization of skin between the inner circle corresponding to the diameter of the areola 4 cm diameter and the outer eccentric circle with a tangent at the 6 o'clock position.  This would result in an elevation of the nipple-areolar complex with transposition.  The epithelialization of the wedge inferiorly equalized the circumference distance between the inner circle and the outer circle.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  After the epithelialization was performed on both sides, nipple-areolar complex was transposed to new nipple position and the wedge was closed with transposition of the nipple-areolar complex beneath the transposed nipple.  Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture on deep subcutaneous tissue and dermal skin closure with running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Dermabond was applied followed by Adaptic and Kerlix in the suturing spaces supportive mildly compressive dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

3, Thoracotomy & Esophageal Exploration ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Esophageal rupture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Esophageal rupture.,OPERATION PERFORMED,1.  Left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection.,2.  Esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation.,3.  Diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy.,4.  Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation.,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia.,INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching.  He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.

The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results.,INDICATION:,  This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention.,COMMENTS: , This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient.  Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed.  The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome.  The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area.  Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure.  When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired.,THORACIC SPINE: , With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine.  The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure.  With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand.  The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure.  The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2.  Cavitation was achieved.,LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS:,  With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal.  Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver.  Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature.  Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver.  The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time).  This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity.  Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance.,With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc.  The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished.  Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees.  This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally.  These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity.,By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistanceorthopedic, fibromyositis, myalgia, segmental dysfunction, sacro-iliitis, spinal manipulation under anesthesia, lumbar segmental dysfunction, informed consent, iliac joints, spinal manipulation, sacro iliitis, lower extremity, spinal, mua, cephalad, dysfunction, segmental, lumbar, "

I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.psychiatry / psychology, nausea, dizziness, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy, positional vertigo, photophobia and dizziness, neurology consultation, tunnel vision, vestibular migraine, migraine symptoms, headaches, photophobia, ataxia, "

After informed consent was reviewed, general anesthesia was induced, initially with propofol, the existing IV.  Following this after protective eye tape was placed, #9 Parson's laryngoscope was introduced transorally and used to perform a direct laryngoscopy.  Normal anatomy was visualized.  Following this, a 4-mm, 20-rigid endoscope was introduced through the Parson's laryngoscope and used to perform a direct tracheoscopy.  The patient's supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis down to the level of the mid trachea were found to be benign with no abnormal-appearing anatomy.  Following this, the rigid endoscope was removed and the patient was intubated with a 4-0 endotracheal tube cuffed without difficulty.  After confirming bilateral breath sounds and positive end tidal CO2, this was secured to the patient by the anesthesia staff.  Following this, the Parson's laryngoscope was removed and a size 4 rigid esophagoscope was inserted transorally and passed down to the level of the patient's cricopharyngeus were the foreign body was visualized.  At this point, the coin grasper device was connected to the camera system and inserted through the existing esophagoscope.  This was used to grasp the coin and the coin was removed under direct visualization and handed off as a separate specimen.  Following this, the 34 mm 0-degree scope was inserted through the esophagoscope once the esophagoscope was passed down to the patient's GE junction.  The entire esophageal mucosa was examined as the esophagoscope was backed out and there was only a minimal amount of superficial ulceration in the posterior wall of the esophagus near the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle.  There were no other lesions or signs of further esophageal damage.  Following this, all instrumentation was removed, and care of the patient was turned back to the anesthesia staff for stable wakeup.,FINDINGS:,1.

1, Spine Fusion ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3.,2.  Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5.,3.  Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis.  This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.surgery, anterior spine fusion, posterior spine fusion, spine segmental instrumentation, dry sterile dressings, autograft and allograft, pds sutures, spinous processes, spine fusion, spine, instrumentation, morcellized, allograft, fusion, autograft, "

Congenital heart disease.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Gastrostomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,This 6-week-old female infant had been transferred to Children's Hospital because of Down syndrome and congenital heart disease.  She has not been able to feed well and in fact has to now be NG tube fed.  Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered.  The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field.  The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall.  A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube.  Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia.  The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL.  A sterile dressing was then applied and the child awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.,pediatrics - neonatal, feeding disorder, down syndrome, congenital heart disease, mic-key tubeless, nurolon, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, syndrome, stomach, gastrostomy"
