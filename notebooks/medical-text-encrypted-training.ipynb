    "Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup> are physicians running their respective medical practices and both have a database of private medical transcriptions. You own a Natural Language Processing (NLP) company and have been contacted by these physicians because both Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup> have heard of the high quality of the Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) solutions you provide and want you to create a text classifier to help them automatically assign a medical specialty to each new patient text transcription."

    "## Limitations\n",

    "Healthcare data is highly regulated and should be, for most intents and purposes, private. Therefore, if in a medical setting, the Machine Learning model being trained should not actually look at the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both Bob's and Alice's datasets, you should be able to create a bigger, better dataset that you could use to train your model with higher accuracy, only that you can't because it's all sensitive and private data, which is why you will need [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/pysyft/) and [SyferText](https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferText/) to complete the job at hand."

Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and MAC anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and neck were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was used to infiltrate the skin in the region of the procedure.  Next a #18-gauge finder needle was used to locate the left subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire through the needle.  This process was repeated.  The 2 J wires and their distal tips were confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, the subcutaneous tunnel was created.  The distal tips of the individual Tesio hemodialysis catheters were pulled through to the level of the cuff.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the individual J wires.  The dilator and wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Tesio hemodialysis catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The process was repeated.  Both distal tips were noted to be in good position.  The Tesio hemodialysis catheters were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The catheters were secured at the cuff level with a 2-0 nylon.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.\"}\n"
