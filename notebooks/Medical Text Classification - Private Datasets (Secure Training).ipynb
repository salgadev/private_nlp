    "As in the previous tutorial, we suppose you run a deep learning company that provides NLP expertise with two clients: Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup>. For this tutorial, we assume each of them are physicians running their respective medical practices and have a database of private medical transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob and Alice have heard of the great services you provide and asked you to create a text classifier to help them automatically assign a medical specialty to each patient transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from both Bob's and Alice's datasets, you would be able to create a bigger dataset that you can use to train a better classifer. Because the nature of the data, you would normally not be allowed to do this because the data is private.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't reveal their data to any third party and you cannot move Bob's data to your company's machines. Same for Alice's. Each dataset is contrained to live on its owner's machine, and they cannot be mixed together to create a bigger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text datasets cannot be consumed directly for training a neural training. You need to create numerical representations of each text review before PySyft can consume it. Text needs to be tokenized first, preprocessed and vector embedding should be used instead of plaintext. But how to do such preprocessing if you are not allowed to have access to plaintext data? \n",
    "\n",
    "As seen before, **SyferText** can help you define preprocessing components that you can send over a network to Bob's and Alice's machine to perform preprocessing remotely, blindly and in a completely secure fashion. SyferText components do all the work from processing plaintext to obtaining its vector representation and encrypting it to hand it over to PySyft models for training. All without you accessing the data, and without the data quitting their owners machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's summarize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to create a bigger dataset out of Bob's and Alice's smaller datasets. *(PySyft has the arsenal for that)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need to prepare and preprocess the text data on Bob's and Alice's machines without revealing it, without moving any datasets to your machine, and without the need to work directly on Bob's or Alice's machines. *(SyferText to the rescue)*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to work with a medical transcriptions sample dataset. Which is a simulated dataset and a public dataset. For this tutorial, we are going to perform exploratory analysis and feature engineering to prepare the data to analysis. Then, we are going to break the data into two parts, send each part to a differet PySyft worker and then train the model."

She is here this morning with her Mom.  She has very large tonsils and she snores at night and gets up frequently at night and does not sleep well.  At the office we saw the tonsils were very big.  There was a rock in the right ear and it was very deep in the canal, near the drum.  We will remove the foreign body under the same anesthetic.,PROCEDURE:,:  Natalie was placed under general anesthetic by the orotracheal route of administration, under Dr. XYZ and Ms. B.  I looked into the left ear under the microscope, took out a little wax and observed a normal eardrum.  On the right side, I took out some impacted wax and removed the rock with a large suction.  It was actually resting on the surface of the drum but had not scarred or damaged the drum.  The drum was intact with no evidence of middle ear fluid.  The microscope was set aside.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils.  The neck was gently extended and the Crowe-Davis mouth gag inserted.  The tonsils and adenoids were very large.  The uvula was intact.  Adenoidectomy was performed using the adenoid curette with a tonsil sponge placed into the nasopharynx.  Tonsillectomy accomplished by sharp and blunt dissection.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery and the tonsils beds injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  Sutures of zero plain catgut next were used to re-approximate the posterior to the anterior tonsillar pillars, suturing these down to the tonsillar beds.  Sponge is removed from the nasopharynx.  The suction electrocautery was used for pinpoint hemostasis on the adenoid bed.  We made sure the cautery tip did not come into the contact with the soft palate or the eustachian tube orifices.  The nose and throat were then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  Excellent hemostasis was observed.  An orogastric tube was placed.  The stomach found to be empty.  The tube was removed, as was the mouth gag.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The child was then awakened and prepared for her to return to the recovery room.  She tolerated the operation excellently.'}\n"
